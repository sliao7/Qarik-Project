SCHEDULE 1 

Project Description 

The objective of the Project is to increase the adoption of integrated and sustainable 
farming systems approaches in specific areas of the Borrower’s territory and help re- 
establish an agricultural productive environment in areas of the Serrana Region affected 
by the January 2011 natural disaster, thus contributing to the higher-order objective of 
increasing small-scale farming productivity and competitiveness in those areas. 

The Project consists of the following components included in the Original Project, as 
amended solely for purposes of the Loan: 

Component 1. Supporting Rural Production and Competitiveness 

Provide assistance to rural producers by working with community groups across local, 
municipal and regional levels to increase organizational and participation skills for 
Project implementation through capacity-building and planning activities; to operate 

changes in rural production processes within a framework of market-driven agricultural 

development focused on sustainable and increased productivity of small farmers, value 

added and market linkages; and to help re-establish the productive environment of small 

farmers affected by the January 2011 natural disaster in the Serrana Region, by 

supporting: 

1.1 Pre-investment activities to strengthen organization and capacity for agricultural 

productivity through training, planning and technical assistance activities in favor of 

Beneficiaries to enable them to identify and diagnose, based on their initial status, key 

production challenges to transition towards more profitable and sustainable farming 

systems, and elaborate investment proposals with special emphasis on production and 

competiveness to gradually overcome those challenges; and 

1.2 Investments to implement 

(a) through the provision of grants (Grants), demand driven activities aimed 
at: (i) improving sustainable and productive farming systems and 

developing value-chains and access to market (Productive Subprojects 
and Structuring Subprojects depending on the Beneficiary); and (ii) 

improving compliance with environmental regulations and adoption of 
agro-ecological and environmentally sound practices, and improving 

sanitation, disaster risk management, and integrated landscape 
management and conservation (Environmental Subprojects and 
Structuring Subprojects depending on the Beneficiary); and



(b) demand-driven activities aimed at erosion control and rehabilitation and 

maintenance of rural roads (Rural Roads Subprojects). 

Component 2. Strengthening Institutional Frameworks 

Improve the Borrower’s institutional frameworks supporting market-driven agricultural 

development by: 

2.1 Strengthening rural institutions and coordination mechanisms through 

capacity-building for the Borrower’s agencies (Beneficiaries) to more quickly and 
effectively respond to rural sector demands, providing better services and coordination 
with other public and private sector stakeholders through, in the short term, the 
implementation of specific activities (Institutional Subprojects) identified in an 
institutional sustainability plan (the Institutional Sustainability Plan) and, in the long 
term, by contributing to the implementation of a national policy in support of territorial 
development. 

2.2 Improving public and private financial support mechanisms through the 

enhancement of linkages between the supply and the demand of financial resources for 

sustainable rural development activities by the development of an economic sustainability 
system, with participation of public and private sector representatives, to promote 
awareness of, and access to, the existing supply of public and private financial support 
resources to Beneficiaries of Productive Subprojects, Environmental Subprojects, and 

Structuring Subprojects and a better flow of financial resources in favor of such 
Beneficiaries; and facilitate the exchange of information between the parties involved. 

2.3 Undertaking participatory research to develop a new and effective operational 
system (the Sustainable Services Research Network System) to conduct, in general, 
agriculture-related research and induce innovation and interaction between research 
bodies and stakeholders in the identification, discussion and prioritization of key issues in 
the agricultural and food sector in the Borrower’s territory and, specifically, provide 
direct support to the implementation of short and medium-term research demands 
identified by Beneficiaries through a participatory process. 

Component 3. Project Coordination and Information Management 

Support the Borrower’s overall Project management, coordination and implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation as well as dissemination of key sustainable rural development 
information under the Project by financing: 

3.1 Project coordination through the strengthening of the organizational and 
operational structure of the Project Implementation Unit; and 

 



3.2 Information management through the development and implementation of a 

management information system that ensures widespread access and adequate 

information flows to impact stakeholder decision-making in support of sustainable rural 
development as well as through the promotion of the use of digital and other information 

technology tools among Project stakeholders and Beneficiaries under Components 1 and 
2 of the Project.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be

Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment

on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 

4, Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs | and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 

on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 

immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (a) the exchange rate that reflects the

amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (b) if the Bank so determines in 

accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 

Rate.
