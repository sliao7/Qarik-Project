LOAN AGREEMENT 

Agreement dated itifye mbed, 2012, entered into between REPUBLIC OF 
COLOMBIA ( - Borrower") and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION 
AND DEVELOPMENT ("Bank") for the purpose of providing financing in support of 
the Program (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement). The Bank has decided to 
provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of (a) the actions which the Borrower has 
already taken under the Program and which are described in Section I of Schedule 1 to 
this Agreement, and (b) the Borrower's maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic 
policy framework. The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 

	

1.01. 	The General Conditions (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement) 
constitute an integral part of this Agreement. 

	

1.02. 	Unless the context requires otherwise, the capitalized terms used in this 
Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in 
the Appendix to this Agreement. 

ARTICLE II — LOAN 

2.01. The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or 
referred to in this Agreement, the amount of two hundred fifty million Dollars 
($250,000,000), as such amount may be converted from time to time through a 
Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this 
Agreement ("Loan"). 

2.02. The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program 
in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. 

2.03. The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one half of one 
percent (0.50%) of the Loan amount. The Borrower shall pay the Front-end Fee 
not later than sixty days after the Effective Date. 

2.04. If, at the Borrower's request and on such terms and conditions as the Bank may 
agree, the Closing Date is extended, the fee payable by the Borrower for each 
extension of the Closing Date shall be at the rate of one quarter of one percent 
(0.25%) of the amount of the Loan available for withdrawal upon such extension. 
If the Borrower elects to capitalize the fee from the Loan, the Bank shall, on 
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and pay to itself such 
amounts required to pay such fee. If the Borrower elects to pay the fee from its 
own resources, the Borrower shall pay such fee not later than sixty days after the 
date of the notice given by the Bank to the Borrower confirming the extension of 
the Closing Date. 



2.05. 	The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate 
equal to the Reference Rate for the Loan Currency plus the Fixed Spread; 
provided, that upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of 
the Loan, the interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on 
such amount shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of 
Article IV of the General Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any 
amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-
payment continues for a period of thirty days, then the interest payable by the 
Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 (e) of the 
General Conditions. 

2.06. The Payment Dates are February 15 and August 15 in each year. 

2.07. 	(a) 	Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this Section, the

provisions of Schedule 2 to this Agreement. 

(b) 	The Borrower may at the time of requesting a Withdrawal also request 
repayment provisions different from those set out in Schedule 2 to this 
Agreement for such Withdrawal, provided that: (i) the average maturity 
of such Withdrawal does not exceed 18 years from the Withdrawal Date 
and the final maturity of such Withdrawal does not exceed 30 years from 
the Withdrawal Date (or such other average maturity and/or final 
maturity as may be generally applicable to loans made by the Bank to the 
Borrower at the time of such agreement), and (ii) such repayment 
provisions have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank prior to 
the Withdrawal Date of such Withdrawal. 

2.08. (a) 	The Borrower may at any time request any of the following Conversions 
of the terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: 
(i) a change of the Loan Currency of all or any portion of the principal 
amount of the Loan, withdrawn, to an Approved Currency; (ii) a change 
of the interest rate basis applicable to: (A) all or any portion of the 
principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable 
Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice versa; or (B) all or any portion of the

Rate based on a Reference Rate and the Variable Spread to a Variable 
Rate based on a Fixed Reference Rate and the Variable Spread, or vice 
versa; or (C) all of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and 
outstanding from a Variable Rate based on a Variable Spread to a 
Variable Rate based on a Fixed Spread; and (iii) the setting of limits on

provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion 
Guidelines. 

2.09. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower may, by notice to the Bank, 
refund any amount of the Withdrawn Balance for the purpose of re-crediting such 
amount to the Loan Account for further withdrawals. Upon such refund, the 
repayment schedule shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis, on terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Bank.

Agreement and relating to Cooperation and Consultation), the Borrower shall 
promptly furnish to the Bank such information relating to the provisions of this 
Article II as the Bank may, from time to time, reasonably request.
