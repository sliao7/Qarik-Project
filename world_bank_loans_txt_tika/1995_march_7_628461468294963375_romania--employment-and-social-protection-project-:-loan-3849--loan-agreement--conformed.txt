(i) a first extension of the bid validity period if the period of 
extension exceeds sixty (60) days and (ii) any subsequent extension 
of the bid validity period. 

(b) In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part 

A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding documents 
issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank 
shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Project. 
Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the
