Procurement Method 

(a)       National Competitive Bidding, subject to the additional provisions set forth in  
 below:

Procurement Method 

language newspapers shall be in compliance with such a 30-day-minimum 
in number of days for bids preparation and submission. 

 
(iii) Bidding shall not be restricted to pre-registered firms.  If registration is 

required, it shall not be denied to eligible bidders for reasons unrelated to 
their capacity and resources to successfully perform the contract (e.g., 
mandatory membership in professional organizations, classification, etc).

capability and resources to successfully perform the contract.

bidding only if they can establish that they are legally and financially 
autonomous, operate under commercial law and are not a dependent 
agency of the Government.  Government-owned enterprises will be subject 
to the same bid and performance security requirements as other bidders. 

 
(v) Procuring entities shall use the appropriate Bank’s sample bidding 

documents, including pre-qualification documents, for the procurement of 
goods, works, or technical services (other than consultants' services), and 
such documents shall contain draft contract and conditions of contract 
including clauses on fraud and corruption, audit and publication of award, 
all acceptable to the Bank. 

 
(vi) Bids shall be opened in public, immediately after the deadline for 

submission of bids.  Bidder’s representatives shall be permitted to attend 
the bid opening. 

 
(vii) Extension of bid validity shall be allowed once only for not more than 

thirty (30) days.  No further extensions should be requested without the 
prior approval of the Bank. 

 
(viii) Evaluation of bids shall be based on quantifiable criteria expressed in 

monetary terms as defined in the bidding documents, no merit point system 
and no domestic preference shall be used in the evaluation of bids. 
Contracts shall be awarded to qualified bidders having submitted the lowest 
evaluated substantially responsive bid and no negotiations shall be carried 
out prior to contract award. 

 
(ix) Civil works contracts of long duration (e.g. more than eighteen (18) 

months) shall contain an appropriate price adjustment clause. 
 



12 

 
Procurement Method

the estimated budget for that procurement.  All bids shall not be rejected 
and new bids solicited without the Bank’s prior concurrence.

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b)

(Expressed as a Percentage)

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 
in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment 
Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable 
to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 



16 

second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable 
on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 
 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 
on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 
immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate. 
 
5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
