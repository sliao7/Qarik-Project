Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully

withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the

Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be

determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the

first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal

Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency

Withdrawn Loan .3alance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I

of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be

repaid on each Frincipal Payment Date falling after the date of such

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

Principal Paymen: Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion

Guidelines, the exchange :-ate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for
each such amount.
