1. For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a) The term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) 
and (6) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

    (b) The term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the Eligible Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

    (c) The term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent



to: (i) one million dollars ($1,000,000) for the BIR Special Account; and (ii) one 
million dollars ($1,000,000) for the BOC Special Account, all to be withdrawn from the 
Loan Account and deposited in the respective Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 
(a) of this Schedule.

2. Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made exclusively for Eligible 
Expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special 
Accounts have been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and 
subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:

    (a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the 
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit in the Special Accounts such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have 
requested.

    (b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Accounts, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the 

Special Accounts at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents 
and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this 

Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of which replenishment 
is requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, 
on behalf of the Borrower,  withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the Special Accounts such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents 
and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Accounts for 

Eligible Expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the 
respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Accounts, the Borrower 
shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
Eligible Expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into a
Special Account:

    (a) If, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or

    (b) Once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the Eligible 
Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, 
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the said Special Account as of the date of such notice will be 
utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of a Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not 
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the 
evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 



Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit 
into the said Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) 
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible 
or justified.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank 
into the said Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

    (b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in a Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for Eligible 
Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

    (c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in a Special Account.

    (d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
