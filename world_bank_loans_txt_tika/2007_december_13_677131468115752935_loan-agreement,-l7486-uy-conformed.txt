SCHEDULE 1 
 

Project Description 
 

The objective of the Project is to support the Borrower’s efforts to further 
strengthen its health delivery services and the current health policy framework for NCD, 
through the expansion of the access and quality of primary health care services related to 
NCD’s early detection, as well as the provision of specialized medical care to avoid or 
reduce exposure to NCD risk factors and their health effects. 

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objective: 

Part 1: Strengthening of the MSP’s Capacity to Address the Borrower’s Changing 
Epidemiological Profile.

(a) Development of a health intelligence information system, focusing on 
optimizing information systems, including epidemiological surveillance and health 
monitoring and evaluation systems, with a special focus on NCD, to ultimately enhance 
DIGESA’s capacity for health policy formulation, through: (i) the creation of an 
inventory of existing databases within the Borrower’s health sector; (ii) the design and 
implementation of an integrated health insurance beneficiary database that would be 
actualized monthly; (iii) the strengthening of the individual databases after the inventory  
referred to in (i) above is concluded to enhance their quality, completeness, and 
connectivity; (iv) the development of additional databases based on the needs identified 
in the same inventory referred to in (i) above; (v) the modernization and consolidation of 
a public health surveillance system, including NCD and its risk factors; (vi) the 
strengthening of the response capacity of selected DIGESA departmental units; and (vii) 
the financing of eligible Subprojects for the development of investigative capacity on 
epidemiological surveillance and disease control (the Research Subprojects). 
 

(b) Development of a national strategy of health promotion, aimed at 
promoting healthy lifestyles and NCD prevention, through: (i) the provision of training, 
equipment and rehabilitation of existing technological infrastructure for the MSP; (ii) the 
creation of the Fund for a Health and Inclusive Uruguay, for the financing of eligible 
Subprojects to strengthen disease prevention and health promotion at the Department 
level (the Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Subprojects); (iii) the carrying out of 
communication campaigns to educate the public on NCD risk factors; and  (iv) the 
development of NCD prevention programs with a focus on vertical (promotion of healthy 
lifestyles) and horizontal prevention (promotion in settings that foster social 
participation). 
 

(c) Strengthening MSP’s capacity to create sound regulatory frameworks 
affecting essential NCD programs, to ensure their adequate enforcement, and to use 



- 6 -

monitoring and management systems to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency, 
through: (i) the provision of technical assistance for the review and optimization of the 
current regulatory framework; and (ii) the provision of technical assistance, training and 
equipment to entities responsible for the certification and quality accreditation of NCD 
medical care procedures at the ambulatory level. 
 
Part 2: Improve Quality of Primary Care Services for Prevalent NCD.

(a) Enhancement of technological infrastructure of primary health care 
facilities, as well as secondary referral centers, through the purchase of the necessary 
medical equipment for the detection and treatment of NCD and other pathologies. 
 

(b) Development and implementation of an efficient monitoring and 
management system aimed at improving the efficiency of primary health care, with 
special emphasis on NCD, through: (i) the strengthening of existing production 
information and monitoring systems; (ii) the adoption of standards for quality assurance 
of care; and (iii) the creation of external certification mechanisms to ensure quality health 
care standards. 
 

(c) Strengthening of the technical capacity of primary health care public 
providers in health promotion, screening, prevention and management of priority NCD, 
as well as increasing the use of primary health care services for NCD among low-income 
populations, through the development and implementation of a human resource 
development program for primary health care teams, including administrative and 
technical personnel, to reorient the health care model towards NCD prevention, health 
promotion activities and quality treatment standards, including the creation of a virtual 
campus to improve access to continuing education for health teams. 
 
Part 3: Implementation of the Previniendo Program

Making Capitation Payments for PPI services financed by the Previniendo 
Program to the Eligible Population listed in each DHIE Beneficiary Registry. 
 
Part 4: Project Management

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as of 
such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 
in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment 
Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable 
to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.  
 
3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable 



- 16 -

on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 
 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  
 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 
on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 
immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate. 
 
5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
