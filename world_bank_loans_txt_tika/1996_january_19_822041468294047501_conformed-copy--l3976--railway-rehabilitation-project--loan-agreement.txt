1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:

     (a)    the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1) and
(2) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this
Agreement;

     (b)    the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required
for Parts A to D, and G of the Project and to be financed out
of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the
eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

     (c)    the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
equivalent to $7,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account
and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3
(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be
limited to an amount equivalent to $2,000,000 until the
aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General
Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of
$10,000,000.

2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule.

3.   After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish
the Special Account shall be made as follows:



     (a)    For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits into the Special Account of an amount or
amounts determined by the Bank to be required to pay for
eligible expenditures during the four months following the date
of each such request, which amount shall not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of
such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit in the
Special Account such amount or amounts as the Bank shall have
determined to be so required.

     (b)    (i)     For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                    Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                    deposits into the Special Account at such
                    intervals as the Bank shall specify.

            (ii)    Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                    Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents
                    and other evidence required pursuant to
                    paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or
                    payments in respect of which replenishment is
                    requested. On the basis of each such request, the
                    Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
                    from the Loan Account and deposit into the
                    Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall
                    have requested and as shall have been shown by
                    said documents and other evidence to have been
                    paid out of the Special Account for eligible
                    expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by
said documents and other evidence.

4.   For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.

5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:

     (a)    if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that
all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

     (b)    if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 5.01 (b)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;

     (c)    if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or

     (d)    once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to Parts A to D, and G of the Project, shall equal the
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.



Thereafter, withdrawals from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to be eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall
specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals
shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6.   (a)    If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall
