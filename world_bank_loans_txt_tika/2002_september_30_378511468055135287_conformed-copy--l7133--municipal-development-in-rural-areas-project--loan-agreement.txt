SCHEDULE 2 

Description of the Project 

The objective of the Project is to reduce the incidence of rural poverty in the 
territory of the Borrower by: (a) supporting investments in basic small-scale social and 
productive infrastructure in rural areas of the Project States, using a community-driven 
development approach; (b) strengthening the administrative and technical capacity of 
rural municipalities to increase the efficiency of municipal investments; and (c) 
deepening the ongoing decentralization of governmental functions from the federal to the 
state and municipal levels. 

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives: 

Part A: Municipal Subprojects

Carrying out investments, according to the terms of the Project Operational 
Manual, to construct or rehabilitate basic small-scale social and productive infrastructure 
in Eligible Municipalities, such as with regard to potable water, sewerage, drainage, 
latrine, urbanization, rural and poor neighborhood electrification, basic health services, 
basic educational services, productive rural and other such infrastructure, all financed in 
part with proceeds of the Municipal Funds Program. 

Part B: Municipal Institutional Development and Support for Decentralization

1. Supporting Project State municipal institutional development -- at the level of an 
individual municipality using its own resources -- through the carrying out of activities 
such as:  (a) training of municipal government personnel; (b) provision of technical 
assistance to improve municipal government performance in the investment subproject 
cycle (from the design through the implementation and monitoring of subprojects) and to 
prepare municipal development plans; (c) provision of technical assistance to improve 
municipal organizations and processes (such as through the drafting of new municipal 
regulations or other such legal instruments); (d) carrying out of studies to diagnose 
municipal government problems and propose and carry out solutions such as through the 
use of maps and cadasters; (e) drafting of manuals, guidelines and other materials to 
disseminate municipal regulations; (f) provision of technical assistance to enhance 
municipal government financial management and reporting; (g) identification and 
dissemination of good practices in the delivery of municipal services; (h) carrying out of 
capacity building activities to assist community groups in enhancing their participation in 
said investment subproject cycle; (i) carrying out studies to diagnose, monitor and/or 
evaluate performance of municipal programs; (j) provision of technical assistance to 
design and implement indicators aimed at measuring progress in the improvement of 



- 21 -

municipal life; and (k) provision of technical assistance to strengthen municipal capacity 
to carry out environmental screening, assessment and enforcement actions regarding 
subprojects. 

2. Supporting municipal institutional development, through activities using 
resources either pooled by a Project State and a number of its municipalities or by such 
municipalities among themselves, which activities: (a) can focus either on an individual 
municipality or be collectively applied to a number of collaborating municipalities; and 
(b) are intended to be standardized in nature (such as standardized training accessible to 
those municipalities that wish to benefit from it, central hot line assistance provided by 
the Project State and development of uniform municipal administrative performance 
indicators). 

3. Supporting municipal institutional development, through activities carried out by 
INAFED in collaboration with Project States (or other states) aimed at improving the 
macro-level framework relevant to the entire municipal sector (such as the constitutional 
and other legal provisions that regulate municipalities, municipal human resource 
administration approaches, certification of municipal competencies, decentralization 
measures aimed at transferring added responsibilities to municipalities, municipal 
financial practices, e-government at the municipal level and promotion of citizenry 
participation in municipal affairs), as well as through the provision by INAFED, to 
municipalities, of computer equipment and software to support the municipalities’ 
institutional development. 

Part C: Project Support, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation

1. Carrying out of investment related activities -- at the municipal level -- not 
covered by direct Subproject costs but essential for Subproject implementation, such as 
technical designs, field support, supervision of Subproject execution (including physical 
inspections). 

2. Carrying out of activities at the Project State level to monitor, supervise, evaluate 
and audit Subprojects, support the operation of the STUs and upgrade Project State 
management information systems applicable to the Municipal Funds Program. 

3. Carrying out of activities at the INAFED level to monitor, supervise, evaluate 
and audit the Project and upgrade INAFED’s management information system applicable 
to the Municipal Funds Program (including the provision of computer hardware and 
software to INAFED in support of such activities). 

* * *

The Project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2006.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 
the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 
Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

 Installment Share 
 Payment Date (Expressed as a %)

On each March 15 and September 15 
 

Beginning March 15, 2008 
through September 15, 2017   5% 

 

2. If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original 
Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 



- 23 -

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate. 

5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

equivalent to $15,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan 
Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the 
equivalent of $25,000,000. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible

has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested.  On the 
basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures.  All such deposits shall be withdrawn by 
the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible 
Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the 
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank 
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further

Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the 
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 



- 30 -

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 
amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as 
the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made 
only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized 
in making payments for eligible expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account:  (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, 
if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such 
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made 
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the 
case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 
the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or 
any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of

cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the 
General Conditions.
