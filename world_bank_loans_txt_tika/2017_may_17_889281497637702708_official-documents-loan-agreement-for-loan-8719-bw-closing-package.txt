SCHEDULE 1

Project Description

The objective of the Project is to improve availability of water supply in drought
vulnerable areas, increase the efficiency of WUC, and strengthen wastewater management
in selected systems.

The Project consists of the following parts:

Part A: Improve Availability of Water Supply and Efficiency of Services

Support for immediate and medium term investments and measures to mitigate the
impact of the drought by improving availability of water in settlements experiencing
extended periods of rationing and/or been forced to rely on water bowsers, including:
(i) water source management, optimization and development, including interlinking of
existing surface and ground water sources, as well as of supply schemes to ensure backup
supply and more sustainable production; (ii) expansion of water supply systems to reach
underserved or drought affected communities; and, (iii) measures to improve operational
efficiency, including reducing technical losses along transmission lines.

Part B: Improve Wastewater and Sludge Management

Support for: (i) strategic investments in refurbishment/rehabilitation of wastewater
treatment facilities to protect surface and groundwater sources and enable scaling up of
wastewater reclamation and reuse in the wastewater treatment facilities of Francistown and
Lobatse, which require urgent attention to prevent environmental contamination caused by
discharge of inadequately treated wastewater into nearby water courses (including those
feeding the Dikgatlhong dam); and (ii) rehabilitation and expansion of sludge management
facilities in Letlhakane.

Part C:Sector Reform and Institutional Strengthening

Support for strengthening the institutional, policy, and legal framework of the
sector to improve long-term water security and increased efficiency of services by
improving allocative efficiency, enhancing technological developments, strengthening
service delivery, and improving water resources stewardship and water demand
management, and strengthening capacity for implementation for timely and efficient
response to the drought, through:

1. Sector Reform: Support to MLWS to improve long term water security, operational
efficiency; and resilience to increasing scarcity and water shocks through support
for the development or roll out of sector policies, legislation and institutions in
support of reforms initiated in 2009, in particular, in the areas of enabling



-7-

regulation of water and wastewater services; monitoring and management of water
resources, and improving service delivery efficiency, and further development and
implementation of integrated water resources management strategies and policies.

2. Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building: (a) support to MLWS (DWA)
to strengthen the capacity to implement sector policies and strategies, improve
water resource planning and monitoring, groundwater development, monitoring,
and regulation; and (b) support to WUC for measures to strengthen capacity to
implement sector policies and strategies, including in relation to business strategy
development, efficiency improvements (e.g. through demand management, cost
recovery, energy reduction, non-revenue water, and innovative ICT use); and
refinement of utility water supply and waste water supply guidelines, policies,
regulations and procedures, targeting underperforming MCs.

3. Forward Planning - Technical Assistance and Studies: (a) Support to MLWS for
technical studies required to develop a pipeline of priority investments aimed at
improving long term water security, analyses and studies for the development of
options for improving water conservation and reuse; and (b) support to WUC for
master plans; feasibility studies; detailed designs; environmental and social impact
assessments, transaction design for PPPs, and expert panels.

4. Project Management. Support for Project implementation capacity to: (a) the

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn
Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this
Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal
Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
