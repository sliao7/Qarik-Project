SCHEDULE 2 

Description of the Project 

The objective of the Project is to assist the MOA and its subordinated 
organizations, as well as local governments, communities and civil society organizations, 
to develop their capacity to prepare for, and implement, the EU Leader Axis during the 
period 2007-2013.   

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives: 

Part A: Creation of Policy and Administrative Framework

Creation of the framework for policy-making processes and administrative 
decision-making between the MOA and its associated national and local level 
institutions, municipalities, local governmental structures, and communities, through the 
provision of technical assistance and goods required:  

(a)  to define the appropriate level of delegation of decision making power 
under the Leader Axis, e.g., level of decentralization of authority for projects selection, 
control and monitoring; 

(b) to assess the status of local- and regional-level administrative authorities, 
specifically their capacities to implement the EU Leader Axis and, on such basis, 
subsequently provide clear recommendations on how to build the necessary skills within 
these authorities; 

(c) to propose the most suitable co–financing system within the new EU 
Leader Axis; 

(d) to assist national and local authorities to prepare all initial strategic 
documents needed for implementation of the EU Leader Axis, with specific reference to 
proposals for the ‘checklist’ for the APA; 

(e) to develop criteria for selection of the Local Action Groups to be funded; 

(f) to develop Guidelines for Local Strategy Development and Guidelines 
for LAG operations; and 

(g) based on the foregoing analyses and recommendations, to build the 
technical capacity, through focused training, in the MOA, APA and local institutions so 
that they will be prepared to implement the new EU Leader Axis.  



- 14 -

Part B: Mapping

Creation of a specialized map of the Borrower’s territory, with specific 
delineation of possible microregions which could be eligible for inclusion in the EU 
Leader Axis pursuant to the relevant criteria from the EU, and which will also assist the 
municipalities in defining their opportunities for cooperation among themselves, through 
the provision of technical assistance required:  

(a) to undertake new analyses of completed and/or ongoing studies on rural 
areas in the country, using existing data to determine the main needs of rural regions from 
the EU Leader Axis perspective; and 

(b) based on the above, to develop a specialized map of Slovak rural areas 
which would be most suitable for implementation of the EU Leader Axis. 

Part C: Formation and Training of Local Action Groups and Implementation of Pilot 
Projects

1. Provision of technical assistance: (i) to form and train selected working groups 
from different microregions across the country which have received training and 
assistance with local development plan formation with the view to assist them further in 
their development to become fully functioning LAGs, including the development of the 
Local Training Manual and the Operational Manual; and (ii) in all eligible areas of the 
country based on the mapping under Part B hereof, to attempt to form at least ten-twelve 
(10-12) fully functional LAGs by the end of 2006.   

2. Carrying out of selected Pilot Projects utilizing the EU Leader Axis in at least (3) 
three regions of the Borrower’s territory, with a view to enable the MOA’s authorities to 
obtain practical experience with this new rural development approach prior to the full 
implementation period in 2007-2013. 

Part D: Creation of National Rural Network

Creation of the framework of the National Rural Network in the Slovak Republic 
to serve as the Leader Contact Point and rural information and data collection center for 
the country, through the provision of technical assistance to assist: (i) the Agency for 
Rural Development in reorganizing, strengthening, and developing its vision for the 



- 15 -

future, including, among others, strategic directions and mission statements, staffing 
plans, and budgets; and (ii) the MOA in undertaking a broader determination of all rural 
actors, responsible authorities/persons, and administrative requirements necessary to
