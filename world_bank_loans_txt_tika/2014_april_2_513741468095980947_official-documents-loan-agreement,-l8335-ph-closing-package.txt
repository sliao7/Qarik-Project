SCHEDULE 3

Amortization Schedule

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates 
of the Loan and the

percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on 
each Principal

Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have 
been fully

withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal 
amount of the

Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date 
shall be

determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of the

first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for 
each Principal

Payment Date[, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, 
to deduct

any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which 
a Currency

Conversion applies.

Principal Payment Date Installment Share
(Expressed as a Percentage)

On each February 15 and August 15

Beginning August 15, 2024

through August 15, 2038 3.33%

On February 15, 2039 3.43%

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn 
as of the first Principal

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on

each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn 
as of

the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay 
the

Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 
I

of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date 
shall be

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of 
such

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying 
the

amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which 
is

the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of 
this

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after 
such

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct 
any

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency

Conversion applies.



-17-

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the

principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as

withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date

following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment

Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which

invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any

withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion

Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (a) the

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the

Conversion; or (b) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for

each such amount.
