pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Annex. 
 
2. Withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows:  
 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which in 
the aggregate do not exceed the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of each such request, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested.  
 

(b) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank 
requests for deposit into the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.  Prior to 
or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and

Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown

total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan minus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall 
equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from 
the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such procedures 
as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on 
deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for 
Eligible Expenditures.
