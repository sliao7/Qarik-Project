repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,

shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of

denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate

that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the

Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if

the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the

exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
