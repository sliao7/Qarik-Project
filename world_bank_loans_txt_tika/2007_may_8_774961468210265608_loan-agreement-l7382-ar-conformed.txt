SCHEDULE 2 

Description of the Project 

The objective of the Project is to reduce the Participating Provinces’ vulnerability to 
flooding, through: (a) the strengthening of their flood emergency and risk reduction capacity; (b) 
the implementation of a housing program for the benefit of the lowest-income population living 
in urban flood-prone areas; and/or (c) the strengthening of flood defenses in geographic areas 
with strong economic activity and vulnerability to recurrent flooding. 

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof as the 
Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such objective: 

Part A: Non Structural Measures

1. Carrying out of one or more non-structural measures in Participating Provinces I, which 
measures may consist (depending on the need for said measures in the pertinent Participating 
Province I, as determined by the Bank) of, inter alia: (a) the design of contingency plans for flood 
emergency (which plans include, inter alia: (i) the carrying out of a diagnosis of the functions and 
responsibilities of the pertinent Provincial Public Institutions, including the implementation of the 
recommendations resulting from said diagnosis, as agreed previously by the pertinent 
Participating Province I and the Bank; and (ii) the simulation of emergency exercises amongst 
said institutions, municipalities and local communities); (b) the design and issuance of regulations 
to the pertinent land use law; (c) the design and implementation of a communications program to 
inform stakeholders about the contents of the regulations mentioned in (b) herein; and (d) the 
design of an environmental program, which program may include, inter alia: (i) the design of 
urban environmental management plans and/or solid waste management plans, all for the benefit 
of cities within Participating Provinces I (as approved by the Bank); and (ii) the design and 
implementation of environmental education and public awareness campaigns in communities 
benefiting from the carrying out of Subprojects. 

2. Carrying out of feasibility studies concerning future flood risk reduction activities, as

preparation of Subprojects II (which assistance may relate to the carrying out of the pertinent 
technical, social and environmental assessments of said Subprojects II). 

Part B: Social Emergency Interventions

1. If the Bank determines that Resettlement will be involved under any given Subproject (as 
referred to in Section 3.08 of this Agreement), carrying out of a housing program for the benefit 
of the population who would be affected by Resettlement under said Subproject and who opt to 
participate in said program, which program consists of, inter alia: (a) land acquisition by the 
pertinent Participating Province I in the market (not through involuntary taking); (b) provision of 
materials for construction of flood-resistant housing in non-flood prone areas by the beneficiaries 
of the program (or by the pertinent Participating Province I in cases where said beneficiaries are 



21

considered disabled); and (c) the strengthening of said beneficiaries’ capacity to carry out the 
housing construction mentioned in (b) herein. 

2. Carrying out of a voluntary housing program in Participating Provinces I for low-income 
families residing in urban areas that are highly vulnerable to floods (which urban areas have not 
benefited or will not benefit from the carrying out of Subprojects), which program consists of, 
inter alia: (a) land acquisition by the pertinent Participating Province I in the market (not through 
involuntary taking); (b) provision of materials for construction of flood-resistant housing in non-
flood prone areas by the beneficiaries of the program (or by the pertinent Participating Province 
in cases where said beneficiaries are considered disabled); and (c) the strengthening of said 
beneficiaries’ capacity to carry out the housing construction mentioned in (b) herein. 

Part C: Structural Measures

1. Carrying out of flood defense investments in Participating Provinces I to (without 
controlling the flow of rivers) protect economically dynamic and flood prone areas within flood 
plains of said provinces, which investments consist of minor additions or alterations of ongoing 
schemes such as: (a) minor construction of flood defense works and reconditioning of 
embankments (including the respective pumping stations); (b) minor construction of storm 
drainage works (including rehabilitation of existing urban and peri-urban drainage networks 
through, inter alia, the carrying out of dredging, straightening and cleaning activities); and (c) 
upgrading of the road bridges’ network, all as approved by the Bank. 

2. If needed, carrying out of any other investment of the same nature (as described in Part 
C.1 above), all as approved by the Bank.

1. Strengthening of the Participating Provinces’ I operational capacity to monitor and 
supervise the implementation of the Project activities under their responsibility. 

 2. Strengthening of the Borrower’s operational capacity to monitor and supervise the overall 
implementation of the Project.

 SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date 
(Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) the total principal 
amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the 
Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as 
necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

 Installment Share 
 Payment Date (Expressed as a %)

On each May 15 and November 15 5% 
 Beginning November 15, 2011 through  
 May 15, 2021  
 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and outstanding as 
of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by 
the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of 
which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule 
for said Principal Payment Date (the Original Installment Share) and the denominator of which 
shall be the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling 
on or after such date, such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal Payment 
Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal 
Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 



23

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if at any 
time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after 
the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply 
to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall be repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank 
by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to said Conversion 
by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if 
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate 
component of the Screen Rate.  

5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time shall be 
denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply 
separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate 
amortization schedule for each such amount.

SCHEDULE 5 

Special Account 

1. For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) the term “eligible Categories” means Categories (1) through (3) set forth in the 
table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement in respect of the Project; 

(b) the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the reasonable 
cost of goods, works and services required for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds 
of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the 
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 

(c) the term “Authorized Allocation” means the amount of $7,000,000 to be 
withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 
3 (a) of this Schedule. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures 
in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been 
duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish 
the Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which 
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit 
into the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account at such intervals 
as the Bank shall specify. 

 (ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant to para-
graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of which 
replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank 
shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and 
deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and other 
evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for eligible 
expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the 
Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the 



29

respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower shall, 
at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall not be 
required to make further deposits into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals should 
be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of 
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; 

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period of time 
specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts 
for the Special Account; 

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention to 
suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan 
Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 

 (d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories for the Project, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered 
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions for the Project, shall equal 
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories for the Project shall follow such procedures as the 
Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after 
and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on 
deposit in the respective Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making 
payments for eligible expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the Special 
Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of 
this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may 
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the 
Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special 
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or 
refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the 



30

Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding 
amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
