and other evidence required pursuant to para- 

graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 

payments in respect of which replenishment is 

requested. On the basis of each such request, the 

Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 

from the Loan Account and deposit into the 

Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 

have requested and as shail have been shown by 

said documents and other evidence to have been 

paid out of the Special Account for eligible 

expenditures. 

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan 

Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the 

respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 

documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special 

Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall 

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 

evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 

expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 

Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 

into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all 

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 

Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the 

General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 

Agreement ; 

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the 
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) 

of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished 

to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the 

records and accounts for the Special Account;

to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated 

to the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all 

outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to 

Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, 

shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized 

Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories 

shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 

the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 

to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such 

amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date 

of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 

expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure 

or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 

Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 

provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 

deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 

refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 

the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 

shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 

Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 

evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 

cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 

shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 

outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 

Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 

(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account 

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General 

Conditions.
