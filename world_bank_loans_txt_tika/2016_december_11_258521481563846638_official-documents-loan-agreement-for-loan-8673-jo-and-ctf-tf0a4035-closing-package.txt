Amortization Schedule

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Non-

Concessional Portion of the Loan and the percentage of the total principal amount
of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment
Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Non-Concessional Portion of
the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the

principal amount of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan repayable by the
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying: (a) the Withdrawn Balance of the Non-Concessional Portion of the
Loan as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each
Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to
deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a

Currency Conversion applies.

Principal Payment Date Installment Share
(Expressed as a Percentage)

On each May 15 and November 15
Beginning November 15, 2021, 1.64%
through May 15, 2051

On November 15, 2051 1.60%

2. If the proceeds of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan have not been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Non-

Concessional Portion of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal
Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Non-Concessional Portion of the
Loan have been withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the
Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Balance of the Non-Concessional
Portion of the Loan as of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this
Schedule 2.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any



-'l-

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan withdrawn within
two calendar months prior to any Principal Payment Date shall, for the
purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any
Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall
be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Balance of the Non-
Concessional Portion of the Loan to an Approved Currency, the amount so
converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal Payment
Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the
Conversion by either (a) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal
in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge
Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (b) if the Bank so determines in
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the
Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Balance of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan is
denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall
apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
