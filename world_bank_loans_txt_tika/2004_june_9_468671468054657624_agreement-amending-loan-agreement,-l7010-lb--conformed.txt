(c) the term “Authorized Allocation” means: (i) in respect of the CDR 

Special Account, an amount equivalent to US$2,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan 
Account and deposited into the CDR Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this 
Schedule; and (ii) in respect of the MEHE Special Account, an amount equivalent to 
US$1,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the MEHE 
Special Account pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; provided, however, that, 
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 
amount equivalent to US$500,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the 
Loan Account of amounts allocated to the MEHE Special Account’s Eligible Categories, 
plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank

Categories, shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$1,000,000. 
 
2. Payments out of the respective Special Account shall be made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule. 
 
3. After the Bank has received evidence that the respective Special Account has 
been duly opened, withdrawals of a Special Account’s Authorized Allocation and 
subsequent withdrawals to replenish the said Special Account shall be made as follows: 
 

(a) For withdrawals of the said Special Account’s Authorized Allocation, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the said Special 
Account of an amount or amounts, which in the aggregate do not exceed the said 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of each such request or requests, the Bank shall, on

behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the said 
Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.  
 

(b) For replenishment of the said Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the said Special Account at such intervals as 
the Bank shall specify.  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of 
this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the said Special Account such amount 
as the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents 
and other evidence to have been paid out of the said Special Account for eligible 
expenditures. Each such deposit into the said Special Account shall be withdrawn by the 
Bank from the Loan Account under one or more of the said Special Account’s eligible 
Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence. 
 
4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the respective Special Account, 
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank 
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures. 
 
5. Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall not 
be required to made further deposits into any Special Account: 

 
(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 

withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) 
of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; 

 
(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period 

of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports 
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the 
records and accounts for the Special Accounts; 

 
(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention 

to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the 
Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or  

 
(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 

Categories minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by 
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of 
twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the respective Special Account as of the date of such notice will 
be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures. 
 
6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
any Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence 
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: 
(A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the 
respective Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an 
amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into any 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made 
such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

 
(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount 

outstanding in any Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 
the Bank such outstanding amount. 

 
(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or 

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the 
General Conditions.”
