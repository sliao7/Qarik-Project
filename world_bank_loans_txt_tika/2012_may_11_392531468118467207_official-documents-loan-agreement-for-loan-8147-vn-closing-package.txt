SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM ("borrower") and INTERNATIONAL BANK

FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("Bank") for the purpose of

providing financing in support of the Program (as defined in the Appendix to this

Agreement). The Bank has decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of

(a) the actions which the Borrower has already taken under the Program and which are

described in Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement, and (b) the Borrower's

maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic policy framework. The Borrower and 
the

Bank therefore hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE II - LOAN

2.01. The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set

Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this

Agreement ("Loan").

2.02. The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program

one

percent (0.25%) of the Loan amount.

2.04. The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a 
rate

equal to the Reference Rate for the Loan Currency plus the Variable Spread;

provided, that upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of

the Loan, the interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on

such amount shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions 
of

Article IV of the General Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
any

amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-

payment continues for a period of thirty (30) days, then the interest payable by



-2-

the Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 (e) of the
General Conditions.

2.05. The Payment Dates are February 15 and August 15 in each year.

2.06. The principal amount of the Loan shall be repaid in accordance with the

Currency; (ii) a change of the interest rate basis applicable to all or any
portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding

all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and

is accepted by the Bank shall be considered a "Conversion", as defined
in the General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the
provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion
Guidelines.

2.08. Without limitation upon the provisions of Section 5.08 of the General
Conditions (renumbered as such pursuant to paragraph 3 of Section II of the

SCHEDULE2

Amortization Schedule

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the
Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be
determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the
first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

Installment Share
Principal Payment Date (Expressed as a Percentage)

On each February 15 and
August 15

2.04%
Beginning February 15, 2018
through August 15, 2041

On February 15, 2042 2.08%

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of
the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I
of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any



-9-

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
