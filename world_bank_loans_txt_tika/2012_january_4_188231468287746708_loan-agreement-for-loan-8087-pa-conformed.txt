LOAN AGREEMENT 

 

Agreement dated January 4, 2012, entered into between REPUBLIC OF PANAMA (“Borrower”) 

and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (“Bank”) 

for the purpose of providing financing in support of the Program (as defined in the Appendix to 

this Agreement).  The Bank has decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of: (a) 

the actions which the Borrower has already taken under the Program and which are described in 

Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower’s maintenance of an adequate 

macroeconomic policy framework. The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as 

follows: 

 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 

 

1.01. The General Conditions (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement) constitute an 
integral part of this Agreement. 

 

1.02. Unless the context requires otherwise, the capitalized terms used in this Agreement have 
the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in the Appendix to this 

Agreement. 

 

ARTICLE II — LOAN 

 

2.01. The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or referred 

to in this Agreement, the amount of sixty six million Dollars ($66,000,000) (“Loan”). 

 

2.02. The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program in 
accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

 
 

 

2.03. The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one half of one percent 
(0.50%) of the Loan amount.  The Borrower shall pay the Front-end Fee not later than 

sixty days after the Effective Date. 

 

2.04. If, at the Borrower’s request and on such terms and conditions as the Bank may agree, the 

Closing Date is extended, the fee payable by the Borrower for each extension of the 

Closing Date shall be at the rate of one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the amount of 
the Loan available for withdrawal upon such extension. If the Borrower elects to 

capitalize the fee from the Loan, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 

from the Loan Account and pay to itself such amounts required to pay such fee.  If the 

Borrower elects to pay the fee from its own resources, the Borrower shall pay such fee 

not later than sixty days after the date of the notice given by the Bank to the Borrower 

confirming the extension of the Closing Date. 

 

2.05.  The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate equal to 

the Reference Rate for the Loan Currency plus the Fixed Spread. Notwithstanding the 

foregoing, if any amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and 

such non-payment continues for a period of thirty days, then the interest payable by the 

Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 (e) of the General 

Conditions.

2.06. The Payment Dates are May 15 and November 15 in each year.

2 to this Agreement. 

 

(b) The Borrower may, at the time of requesting a Withdrawal, also request 

repayment provisions different from those set out in Schedule 2 to this 

Agreement for such Withdrawal, provided that: (i) the average maturity of such

maturity of such Withdrawal does not exceed 30 years from the Withdrawal Date 

(or such other average maturity and/or final maturity as may be generally 

applicable to loans made by the Bank to the Borrower at the time of such 

agreement); and (ii) such repayment provisions have been agreed between the 

Borrower and the Bank prior to the Withdrawal Date of such Withdrawal. 

 

2.08. (a) In order to facilitate prudent debt management, the Borrower may at any time 

request a Conversion of the interest rate basis applicable to all or any portion of 

the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable 

Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice versa, or from a Variable Rate based on a Variable 

Spread to a Variable Rate based on a Fixed Spread.

be adjusted on a pro rata basis, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.

3.01. The Borrower declares its commitment to the Program and its implementation.  To this 

end, and further to Section 5.08 of the General Conditions:

2. The Borrower, through SINAPROC, has adopted the PNGR. 
 

3. DICRE has furnished to the Borrower’s Executive Branch a proposal to expand

Section II. Availability of Loan Proceeds 

 

A. General.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance with the 

provisions of this Section and such additional instructions as the Bank may specify by 

notice to the Borrower. 

 

B. Allocation of Loan Amounts.  The Loan is allocated in a single withdrawal tranche, 

from which the Borrower may make withdrawals of the Loan proceeds.  The allocation of 

the amounts of the Loan to this end is set out in the table below: 

 

Allocations Amount of the Loan 

Allocated 

(expressed in Dollars) 

(1) Single Withdrawal Tranche 66,000,000

C. Payment of Front-end Fee.  No withdrawal shall be made from the Loan Account until 

the Bank has received payment in full of the Front-end Fee.  

 

D. Payment of Fee Pursuant to Section 2.04 of Agreement.  If the Closing Date is 

extended pursuant to Section 2.04 of this Agreement and the Borrower elects to finance 

from its own resources the fee set forth in said Section, no withdrawal shall be made from 

the Loan Account until the Bank has received payment in full of such fee. 

 

E. Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds.

disaster which has been declared by the Borrower, through an Executive Decree 

(Decreto Ejecutivo), all in accordance with the Borrower’s legislation. 

 

2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the receipt by the Bank of 

a request for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, the Bank determines that a 

review of the Borrower’s progress in carrying out the Program is warranted, the 

Bank shall give notice to the Borrower to that effect.  Upon the giving of such 

notice, no withdrawals shall be made of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance unless 

and until the Bank has notified the Borrower of its satisfaction, after an exchange 

of views as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 3.01 of this 

Agreement, with the progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the 

Program.

1. all withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into an 

account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank; and

3. furnish to the Bank such other information concerning the account and its audit 
as the Bank shall reasonably request. 

 

H. Excluded Expenditures.  The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall 

not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines at any time that an 

amount of the Loan was used to make a payment for an Excluded Expenditure, the 

Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund an amount equal to the 

amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request 

shall be cancelled.

Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 

the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 

Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 

multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 

the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date. 

 

Principal Payment Date Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage)

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 

Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 

as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 

determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 

fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 

table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 

Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 

Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 

date.
 
 

 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 

amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 

outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 

withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 

with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 

on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-

paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 

such billing system.
