ANNEX
to

Schedule 2

PPP Guidelines

The purpose of these PPP Guidelines is to describe the specific arrangements for
implementing the PPP and Open Access model desired by the Recipient authorities in
order to: (i) meet scheduling requirements (in order to select the Operator) as soon as
possible for the establishment of the ACE cable and Libreville-Port Gentil connectivity;
(ii) construct and operate the digital infrastructure which the country needs in order to
support the diversification of its economy; and (iii) achieve the final goals of the Project
within five years (increased geographical coverage of high-bandwidth networks and
lower cost of communication services in Gabon). As such, these arrangements shall
serve as a reference for all Project activities.

* The concept of "Public-Private Partnership" refers to various possible types of
long-term contractual relationships between the authorities and the private sector,
for the design, execution, operation, maintenance and financing of equipment or
infrastructure and/or the organization of services to the public. Public-Private
Partnerships enable a government to leverage the management skills of private
enterprises, the productivity gains and cost savings which they will achieve, the
innovations which they will provide and the possibility of using private
investments instead of public financing, which can then be used for other
projects.

* The concept of "Open Access" refers to access to terrestrial or submarine fiber
optic systems by operators or service providers (holders of a telecommunications
operating license or permit to engage in the provision of telecommunications
infrastructure or services) on non-discriminatory, transparent terms (for pricing
and non-pricing aspects) and cost-based pricing.

* Under these guidelines, the "private sector" means any private economic operator
(including those possessing a telecommunications operating license or a permit to
engage in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure or services in
Gabon).

1. A joint stock company under Gabonese law (ad hoc holding company
("HoldCo", the SPV) to be established by the Recipient to be the owner of all
terrestrial and submarine fiber optic infrastructure constructed by the Gabonese
Republic. At the time of its establishment, all shares of HoldCo will be owned
by the Recipient and the principle of offering shares to the private sector and the
principle of Open Access shall be reflected in all relevant official and constituent
documents relating to HoldCo ("HoldCo Corporate Documents").



- 23 -

a. Selection of service providers and consultants for the construction of the
fiber optic infrastructures (excluding Part 2.1 of the Project) financed by
the Loan shall be done in accordance with applicable Bank's policies,
procedures, rules and guidelines concerning procurement, financial
management and anti-corruption measures and environmental and social
safeguards.

b. Disbursements in relation to contracts for works relating to the
construction of fiber optic infrastructure (excluding Part 2.1 of the
Project) shall commence as soon as the private infrastructure operator is
in place in accordance with the arrangements described in paragraph 3
below. Subsequent disbursements shall be made in installments at key
stages in the construction to be defined with the Recipient (for example,
completion of civil engineering works, installation of transmission
equipment, etc.). Disbursements shall be based on a detailed certified
statement of expenditure, after confirmation by an independent engineer
that the key construction phase has indeed been reached.

2. HoldCo shall establish a wholly-owned subsidiary (the ACE Subsidiary). The
ACE Subsidiary shall be the owner of the ACE submarine cable and of its land
leg and its landing station (assets covered by the Construction and Maintenance
Agreement). Subject to the approval by the ACE Consortium and in accordance
with the C&MA, the Recipient shall transfer its rights and obligations under the
C&MA to the ACE Subsidiary.

a. Since these assets are the ones most likely to attract private sector
investment, all the HoldCo Corporate Documents shall be worded so as
to allow the use of private sector capital whenever this is considered
appropriate by the Recipient in compliance with the principles of Open
Access (for example, if it should prove necessary to resort to private
financing to finance upgrades of international capacity needed to meet
expressed demand in order to avoid artificial rationing of ACE capacity).

b. To this end, the HoldCo Corporate Documents shall include the
following provisions:

i. ACE capacity shall be officially attached to shares and
automatically transferred to shareholders when possessing a
valid telecommunications operators license. In the case of
telecommunications operators, acquisition of shares shall result
in acquisition of corresponding capacity, since possession of
capacity becomes an ownership right inseparable from the
right to dividends and the right to vote.



- 24 -

ii. The share transfer price shall be fixed by a valuation method
usually adopted by businesses in the ICT sector, such as the
discounted cash flow method, the comparable transactions
method, the market multiples method or a suitable combination
of these methods. The feasibility of converting indefeasible
rights of use ("IRUs") (see below) into shares of the ACE
Subsidiary shall also be analyzed.

iii. The principle of prohibiting warehousing of capacity shall be
embodied in all relevant official and constituent documents
relating to the ACE Subsidiary. This means that no
shareholder may retain shares and capacity without using such
capacity nor refuse to transfer such capacity (and shares
associated with such capacity) to another shareholder that
would be in a position to use them.

iv. HoldCo shall have a "golden share" in the ACE Subsidiary
granting HoldCo specific rights such as the right to a seat on
the board of directors of the ACE Subsidiary, the right not to
have its shares in the ACE Subsidiary diluted and the right to
veto any decisions taken by the ACE Subsidiary that might
undermine the principle of Open Access.

v. Use of a precise mathematical valuation formula to calculate
IRU prices with a demand scenario that is both voluntary
(aimed at fully satisfying potential demand) and realistic.

c. Disbursements by the Bank in respect of participation in the ACE
Consortium shall be made only after the Recipient has established
HoldCo and the ACE Subsidiary.

3. HoldCo and the ACE Subsidiary shall delegate the operation, maintenance and
commercialization of its assets to an Operator with proven experience, selected
by means of an international, open, transparent and non-discriminatory
competitive tender. The Operator shall contribute its technical expertise and a
commercial interest in operating the infrastructure efficiently because it is free to
commercialize the capacity of the backbone network (subject to the provisions of
its license and its agreement). Preparation of the tender documentation,
including drafting of the operation, maintenance and commercialization contract
and of the draft license, as well as assistance to the Gabonese Republic in the
negotiations to select the Operator, shall be done through an international firm
financed under the Project.



- 25 -

a. The Operator shall be granted a telecommunications license authorizing
it to engage in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure and
services in the Gabonese Republic. This authorization shall be limited to
wholesale markets for operators and service providers holding a valid
telecommunications license or permit to engage in the provision of
telecommunications infrastructure or services within or outside the
Gabonese Republic.

b. The relationship between the Operator and ANINF or any other entity
duly authorized for the communication requirements of the Gabonese
Republic shall be clearly defined in the operation and commercialization
contract, after the Recipient's authorities have reviewed the various
options available.

c. The operation and commercialization contract ("ACE Wholesale
Contract") between HoldCo and the Operator shall have a maximum
validity of three years.

d. The ACE Wholesale Contract shall provide a reference offer containing
provisions detailing (including a list of standard speeds), pricing (cost
basis, price revision clause), service levels and quality commitments, co-
location of equipment at the Operator's technical sites, etc., guaranteeing
respect for the principles of Open Access (neutrality, non-discrimination,
transparency). The reference offer should allow a maximum number of
operators and suppliers to access fiber optic infrastructure capacity,
ensuring that they all receive the best possible rates, thanks to a better
fiber filling rate. When arrangements are being made concerning
specific terms, the advisability of proposing dark fiber on segments of
the national backbone shall be considered.

e. In order to allow for resale to operators and service providers on retail
markets, the Operator shall be required to limit its service offerings to
offerings of capacity. In particular, this precludes managed bandwidth
services such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and provision of
installation and maintenance services.

f. The ACE Wholesale Contract shall also include specific pricing and non-
pricing provisions for transborder interconnection with the Congolese
backbone financed by the Bank in the context of the Third Phase of the
Central African Backbone Program - Republic of Congo Project (Credit
No.4974-CG).



-26-

4. In order to accelerate high-speed Internet access for the benefit of consumers and
businesses in Gabon and to develop transborder traffic (particularly via the
Gabon - Congo interconnection), the Operator shall charge its customers more
attractive prices than the reference offer through purchase of IRUs for bandwith
connectivity, so that customers can formulate business plans and create a virtuous
cycle on retail markets: lower prices -> higher volumes ->lower unit costs for
international connectivity as a result of upgrades -> lower prices, etc.

a. Any operator or telecommunications service provider possessing a valid
telecommunications license or permit to provide infrastructure or
services in the Gabonese Republic may acquire IRUs from the Operator
under the Open Access terms.

b. Several types of IRU shall be granted by the Operator:

i. Packets of STM1/8000 km for the ACE component, or a
slightly greater capacity than a link to Europe (STMI x km is a
unit of measurement for links between landing points of the
ACE cable. It corresponds to transmission at a speed of 1
STMI (155 Mbps) over I km. The distance to Penmarch
(France) is 7,208 km, compared with 6,324 to Sesimbra
(Portugal). The additional 8,000 can be used for shorter links
(Abidjan 1,980 km away and Bata 176 km away) for an initial
period of eight years. Since the lifetime of the cable is
between 20 and 25 years, the initial duration of the IRU could
be extended automatically if the cable is still being operated
after eight years, provided that additional IRUs are purchased
for a further period, at prices to be determined by a valuation
formula.

ii. Packets of STM1/180 km for the Libreville - Port Gentil
component, for an initial period of eight years. Since the
lifetime of the cable is between 20 and 25 years, the initial
duration of the IRU could be extended automatically if the
cable is still being operated after eight years, provided that
additional IRUs are purchased for a further period, at prices to
be determined by a valuation formula.

iii. Packets of STM1/km to be determined for the other national
backbone segments.



-27-

c. All IRU prices (ACE, Libreville - Port Gentil, other national backbone
segments) shall be established by a precise valuation formula ensuring
that they are based on costs and shall be specified in the operation and
commercialization contract. In the case of the ACE component, the IRU
for STMI/8000 kin, the model business plan prepared for the Project
indicates that the IRU price should be less than US$1 million (scenario
2) for the ACE component.

d. The Recipient authorities are establishing a shared local fiber optic
infrastructure for access to national and international connectivity in
order to reduce local access costs (backhaul). Any operator purchasing
IRUs shall nevertheless be able to access the landing station through its
own infrastructure, subject to the statutory arrangements, and to co-
locate its equipment there for access to international connectivity, if so
desired.

5. Since the Project is designed to expand the geographical coverage of high-
capacity bandwidth and to reduce the cost of communication services in the
Gabonese Republic, the operation and commercialization contract drawn up by
the Recipient shall specify a series of key performance indicators (KPIs),
including maximum prices, minimum levels of service quality and of
profitability, on which the Operator shall be required to report publicly each year.
The performance of the Operator in the light of these KPIs shall be analyzed
jointly with the Recipient authorities each year and, if there are problems, the
Recipient and the Bank shall identify possible options for solving them and shall
recommend the solution to be adopted in order to attain the Project goals.

on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination
immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency
Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in
