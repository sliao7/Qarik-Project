amount equal to the amount of said payment, or (ii) if the Bank shall so request,

first Interest Payment Date occurring thereafter, and after the 
initial period, each period from and including an Interest Payment 
Date to, but excluding, the next following Interest Payment Date. 

(ii) “Interest Payment Date” means any date specified in Section 
2.06 of this Agreement. 

(iii) “LIBOR Base Rate” means, for each Interest Period, the 
London interbank offered rate for six-month deposits in 

dollars for value the first day of such Interest Period (or, in the 
case of the initial Interest Period, for value the Interest Payment 
Date occurring on or next preceding the first day of such Interest 
Period), as reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a 
percentage per annum.

(iv) “LIBOR Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: (A) 
one half of one percent (1/2 of 1%); (B) minus (or plus) the

determines that it is in the interest of its borrowers as a whole and of the Bank to 
apply a basis for determining the interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as 
provided in said Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest 
rates applicable to the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower 
of the new basis. The basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice period 
unless the Borrower notifies the Bank during said period of its objection thereto, in 
which case said modification shall not apply to the Loan.
