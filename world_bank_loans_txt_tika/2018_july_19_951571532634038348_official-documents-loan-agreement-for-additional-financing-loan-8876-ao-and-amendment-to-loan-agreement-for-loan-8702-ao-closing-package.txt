Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I

of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount

of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the

original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each
such amount.
