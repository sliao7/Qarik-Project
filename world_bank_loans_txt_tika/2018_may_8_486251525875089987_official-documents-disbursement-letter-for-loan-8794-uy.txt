The Bank may permit the Borrower to electronically deliver applications (with supporting documents) 

through the Bank’s web-based portal (https://clientconnection.worldbank.org) “Client Connection”. This 

option may be effected if the officials designated in writing by the Borrower who are authorized to sign and 

deliver Applications have registered as users of “Client Connection”. The designated officials may deliver 

Applications electronically by completing the Form 2380, which is accessible through “Client Connection”. 

By signing the Authorized Signatory Letter, the Borrower confirms that it is authorizing such persons 
to accept Secure Identification Credentials (SIDC) and to deliver the Applications and supporting

discretion, temporarily or permanently disallow the electronic delivery of Applications by the Borrower. 

By designating officials to use SIDC and by choosing to deliver the Applications electronically, the 

Borrower confirms through the authorized signatory letter its agreement to: (a) abide by the Terms and 

Conditions of Use of Secure Identification Credentials in connection with Use of Electronic Means to 

Process Applications and Supporting Documentation, available in the Bank's public website at 

https://worldbank.org and “Client Connection”; and (b) to cause such official to abide by those terms and 

conditions.
