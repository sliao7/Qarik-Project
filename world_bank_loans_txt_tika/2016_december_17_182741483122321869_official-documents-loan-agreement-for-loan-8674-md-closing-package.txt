Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,

Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating
to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so detenrines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
