of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in 



the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the 
Original Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all 
remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after 
such date, such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two months prior to any Principal Payment Date 
shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any 
Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the 
date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such 
sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the 
Loan to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that 
shall be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate 
that reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank 
under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank 
so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate 
component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

the Guidelines regarding national competitive bidding procedures. Bidding documents 
acceptable to the Bank and in a standardized form for the Project shall be also used 
in the procurement under this Part C.1. Without limitation to any other provision of 
this Schedule or the Guidelines or Schedule 5 to this Loan Agreement, the following 
shall apply to the procurement of goods or works to be undertaken pursuant to this 
Part C.1: 

(a) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or Colombians, 
will be treated equally and, particularly, no preference will be granted to any bidder 
or group of bidders for bid evaluation purposes. Bidders shall be allowed to submit 
their bids by hand or through the post office or private mailing services. There shall 
not be any requirement for any bidder to show evidence of the bidder’s registration in 
any public registry, chamber of commerce or similar entity, whether in Colombia or 
elsewhere, or to appoint a representative domiciled in Colombia, unless and until such 
bidder is awarded the corresponding contract.

(b) Bids shall be opened in a public meeting to which bidders and their 
representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and place for 
the opening meeting shall be set forth in the bidding documents. Bid opening shall 
coincide with, or take place promptly after, the final date and time of the period for 
bid submission stipulated in the bidding documents.

(c) Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to the 
responsive bidder who meets appropriate technical and financial standards of 
capability and whose bid has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid. Such 
determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the specifications, conditions 
and evaluation criteria stipulated in the bidding documents. If any factor additional 
to the amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid evaluation, such 
factor or factors and the quantified manner on which they will be applied for purposes 
of determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely stipulated in the bidding 
documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and comparison, the only bid amount or 
amounts to be used as a factor shall be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in the 
corresponding bid, including correction of arithmetic errors.

(d) The provisions of paragraph 2.46 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, 
more specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the persons 
officially charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating the bids while they 
are performing their official duties, without the corresponding bidder’s written 
authorization. Moreover, bidders shall not be required to provide such authorization 
as a condition to be entitled to bid. This confidentiality requirement shall apply 
until the award of contract is notified to the successful bidder. Thereafter, 
confidentiality of the bids shall be limited to those bid portions for which 
confidentiality has been specifically requested by the bidder in question.

qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation 
shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the 
required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and 
relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who 
offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience 
and resources to complete the contract successfully.

4. BOO/BOT/BOOT Procurement

In respect of each Subproject under Part A.2 of the Project, the terms and 
conditions of the draft Subproject Agreement and the rest of the bidding documents for 
such Subproject, including the corresponding POI, shall describe the construction or 
rehabilitation works to be undertaken, in connection with the Water Utility in 
question, by the corresponding Constructor/Operator. Each Constructor/Operator: (a) 
shall be selected, for such Subproject, on the basis of national competitive bidding 
procedures in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.3, 3.4 and 3.13 (a) of 
the Guidelines; and (b)  shall be responsible for the execution of part or all of the 
corresponding works in its role as  constructor. Each Constructor/Operator in question 
shall start performing under the corresponding Subproject Agreement by discharging its 
responsibilities as operator of then current water system. Once the construction phase 
commences the two types of responsibilities (as constructor and as operator) will 
overlap until a point in time in which, by  the acceptance by the corresponding 
Participating Municipality of all the works to be executed by the 
Constructor/Operator, and without prejudice to any subsisting legal responsibility as 
constructor for the works so executed, the Constructor/Operator in question will 
return to one single role, that of operator. Subsequently, at any point in time, and 
subject to the provisions of the applicable Subproject Agreement and POI, and the then 
current circumstances, if the Constructor/Operator in question, as operator, 
determines that there is need for additional works, then, subject to the decision of 
the Participating Municipality in question, the additional works shall be procured in 
accordance with the applicable procedures of the Constructor/Operator, including the 
execution of such additional works by the Constructor/Operator itself.

SCHEDULE 5

Implementation Program

1. Introduction

The core and principal purpose of the Project is the carrying out of Subprojects 
in Participating Municipalities: (a) in the Caribbean Region; and (b) in regions of 
the Borrower’ s territories other than the Caribbean Region, and the increased 
provision of financial support to said Subprojects from financial sources other than, 
and as an alternative to, the Borrower’s or, to some extent, the Municipality (ies)’ 
in question. The provisions of this Schedule shall provide the framework for certain 
activities related to the Subproject cycle, from identification to execution, and 
shall apply to all Subprojects, with the exception of those provisions concerning or 
referring exclusively to the Loan or Loan proceeds, which shall apply only to 
Subprojects in the Caribbean Region. 

2. Subprojects

Each Subproject in a Participating Municipality will consist in the execution of 
civil works and the acquisition and installation of equipment, both for water supply 
and sanitation purposes, and the management and operation of the corresponding 
facilities, all of which shall be financed with a combination of funds provided from 
different sources, which may vary for every Subproject and will consist of one or more 
of the following, as the case may be:

(a) a contribution from the Borrower to the cost of said infrastructure 
investments in the Subproject in question, to the extent the investments in question  
cannot be fully financed by the private sector under (b) (i) because the Tariff levels 
will not be sufficient to recover the cost of the private sector investments in 
question;

(b) (i)  the investment funds committed by every Operator of Subprojects  in 
Medium Size Municipalities or by some or all of the Constructor/Operators of  
Subprojects in Small Municipalities, under the corresponding Subproject Agreement, 
which funds said Operators or Constructor/Operators, as the case may be, expect to  
recover  from the income to be earned as managers of the Water Utility in question; 
and (ii) the contributions committed by the corresponding Participating Municipality 
or Municipalities under the corresponding Subproject Agreement, for each fiscal year 
during the agreed term for the carrying out of said Subproject, derived from: (A) a 
given portion of such Municipality’s or Municipalities’ Law 60 Income; or (B) other 



alternative source or sources available to the Municipality or Municipalities in 
question.

3. Eligibility Criteria

The following eligibility criteria shall be met by every Municipality wishing to 
become a Participating Municipality. The General Director of Water and Basic 
Sanitation of MED, as provided for in the Manual, will decide on each petition 
received in order to determine whether the Municipalities in question (individually or 
grouped) qualify as a Small Municipality or Medium Size Municipality. Since the 
participation of Municipalities in the Project will be demand driven, based on the 
premise of first come, first served, while the funds available will be limited, there 
will be a need for establishing a ranking order. Said order shall be determined by the 
date stipulated under the corresponding Technical Assistance Agreement to begin, in 
accordance with the terms of the agreement in question, the activities provided for 
under said agreement. Every Technical Assistance Agreement to be entered into shall be 
drafted following the Model for that type of agreement to be accepted for purposes of 
compliance with the effectiveness condition stipulated under paragraph (c) of Section 
7.01 of this Loan Agreement. Any material change in said model or departure from its 
provisions shall require the prior approval of the Bank.  All other decisions in 
connection with the acceptance or rejection of a given Municipality shall be made by 
MED’s General Director of Water and Basic Sanitation, as provided for in the Manual.

(a) Eligibility criteria for Small Municipalities:

commonly referred to as "condominial approach"; and (II) the 
methodology applied in Colombia commonly known as "asas" 
(alcantarillados sin arrastre de sólidos); (B) will have excluded 

any possibility of resettlement for each member of the Population 
involved, caused by the Subproject in question; and (C) will have 

required that works be carried out in accordance with the

served, by a Regional Water Utility, may be deemed a Medium Size 
Municipality (as long as the excess Population shall not exceed 
the high limit of the range by more than 20%);

(ii) the corresponding Mayor and Local Water Utility or Regional 
Utility, as the case may be, have agreed to the subsidy principles

Committee of Socioeconomic Stratification of the Municipality in 
question, using the methodologies elaborated by the Borrower’s 
National Planning Department, as belonging to the three lower 
strata (1, 2 and 3), all in accordance with and within the terms 
of the Borrower’s Laws 142 of 1994 and 505 of 1999;

repay 80% of the costs of preparation for said participation if 
such Municipality or Municipalities fail to fulfill their 
commitments under said agreement or somehow terminate or rescind 
said agreement or cause the termination of rescission thereof; (B) 
the Tariff for the said provision of services shall be brought to 

levels that will ensure the coverage of, at least, administration, 
operation and  maintenance costs and will further reach, if not 
yet attained, the maximum socially acceptable levels so as to make 
possible a contribution to the corresponding water system 
expansion costs; (C) an amount equivalent to a certain and 
specific percentage of the Law 60 Income corresponding to the 
Municipality or to each of the Municipalities in question, ranging 
from 8% to 20%, shall be provided by such Municipality(ies) either 
from such Municipality’(ies’) Law 60 Income or other specific 
municipal resources; (D) the Mayor(s) of the corresponding 
Municipality(ies) shall carry out a campaign aimed at informing 
the community of the Municipality(ies) in question about the 
proposed reform, the private sector participation model to be 
used, and the principles of the Tariff adjustment necessarily 
involved; and (E) the corresponding Subproject Agreement shall 
include the following Operator’s obligations: (I) to prepare the 
environmental assessment of the required construction and/or 
rehabilitation works under, and to carry out contemporaneously 
with the said works an environmental concern mitigation plan for, 

the Subproject, both of which shall require the approval of the 
Bank prior to their implementation; and (II) the corresponding 
Municipality’s(ies) obligation to obtain the applicable 
environmental license or licenses, if and when required.

(c) Eligibility Criteria for Medium-Size Municipalities under Part A.1 and

involving private sector participation in the management and operation of  Water 
Utilities, provided that the parties to said contracts are agreeable to modify, if 
necessary, certain terms and conditions of the corresponding contracts in order to 
make them eligible for financing under the Project:

(i) that the Operator shall have been selected through a competitive 
bidding process acceptable to the Bank;

(ii) that  the agreed Tariff levels, and the amount of Borrower’s or 
Municipality’(ies’) resources to be provided, for the proposed 
Early Subproject in question, are compatible with the provisions 
of (b) (v) (B) above and (b) (v) (C) above, respectively or, 
alternatively, that the parties to the Subproject Agreement are 
willing to bring said Tariff and amounts to the required levels;

(iii) if and when necessary, that the proposed Operator and the 
Municipality or Municipalities involved agree: (A) to modify the

Bank; and

(iv) that all other criteria under (b) (i), (b) (ii), (b) (iii) and (b) 
(iv) above, shall have been met.

4. Technical Assistance and Subproject Agreements

Each Municipality that wishes to participate in the Project and meets the 
criteria for eligibility stipulated in paragraph 3 of this Schedule shall enter into a 
Technical Assistance Agreement with the Borrower, using, for that purpose the Model 
prepared by the Borrower and accepted by the Bank for purposes of compliance with the 
effectiveness conditions stipulated under Section 7.01 (c) of this Agreement. Such 
Model shall not be changed without the prior approval of the Bank and, unless the 



change or changes in question had been accepted in the Bank for any further use of the 
Model, said changes shall not be used by other Municipalities without the prior 
approval by the Bank. The PIU shall provide the technical assistance required by the 
Participating Municipality in question and the respective costs shall be defrayed with 
proceeds of the Loan allocated to Category (4) of the Table.

Once a Technical Assistance Agreement shall have become effective, the services 
of engineering and financial consultants shall be hired by the Participating 
Municipality in question to prepare, respectively, the POI and the financial 
projections, both for the corresponding Water Utility to be privatized. The PIU, in 
cooperation with the authorities of the Participating Municipality in question, will 
incorporate the investment and financial data produced with the technical assistance 
into the corresponding draft Subproject Agreement to be entered into between the 
Borrower and/or the Participating Municipality and the selected Operator or 
Constructor/Operator in question. For that purpose, the PIU shall use the 
corresponding Model to the maximum extent possible, as well as the model bidding 
documents approved by the Bank so as to be used in the bidding process that will be 
followed in order to select the corresponding Operator or Constructor/Operator, as the 
case may be, a bidding process that will require, as well, the approval of the Bank in 
respect of Parts A.1 and A.2 of the Project in conformity with the provisions of Part 
D.2 (a) and (c) of Section I of Schedule 4 hereto. 

The investment to be made in the Subproject by the selected Operator or 
Constructor/Operator will depend on the rate levels of the Adjusted Tariff of the 
Participating Municipality in question, since the basic principle of the Subproject 
contract is that the investment commitment of the Operator or Constructor/Operator 
shall be compatible with the level of income to be earned under the Adjusted Tariff 
from the users of the water and sewerage services in question.

The proceeds of the Loan allocated to each Participating Municipality will be 
determined on the basis of the financial model utilized during the preparation of the 
Subproject in question, subject to the degree of progress achieved by the Municipality 
in question in the preparation of such Subproject and the availability of Loan 
proceeds. If the amount of Loan proceeds requested by the winning bidder during the 
bidding process to select an Operator for such Project is not available, the amount to 
be provided will at least ensure the sustainability of the Subproject. The proceeds in 
question shall not be transferred to said Operator, but rather used to finance the 
works considered of high priority by said Operator to the extent approved by the 
authorities of the Participating Municipality in question and by the PIU.

5. Flow of funds

The proceeds of the Loan  to be used for the financing of Parts A.1 and A.2 of 
the Project, shall flow first into the Special Account upon receipt by the Bank of 
satisfactory withdrawal applications from the Borrower for such proceeds.

(a) Part A of the Project:

The Administrator Account and the Project Account shall receive all funds 
allocated, respectively: (i) for goods and works for Subprojects under Parts A. 1 and 
A.2 of the Project from Loan proceeds; and (ii) for goods and works for Subprojects 
under Part A.3 of the Project, from Borrower’s counterpart funds:

(A) The funds flowing through the Administrator Account shall be

shall be made to constructors and suppliers for such 
Subprojects; or (II) Subprojects under Part A.2 of the

The funds flowing through the said Designated Account shall be Loan proceeds 
first withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account with the 
specific purpose of defraying expenditures eligible for financing under the Loan and

funds sufficient to cover no more than Project expenditures under said Parts of the 
Project expected to be incurred during the thirty consecutive calendar days 
immediately after such deposit shall be made.

In the case of unexpected situations that, in the Bank’s opinion, impede, or 
otherwise create significant delays in the aforesaid flow of funds procedures, the 
Bank may undertake to make direct payments with Loan proceeds to providers of goods or 
services under the Project (other than Part A.3 thereof), or to the Borrower so as to 
reimburse Borrower’s payments to such providers.
