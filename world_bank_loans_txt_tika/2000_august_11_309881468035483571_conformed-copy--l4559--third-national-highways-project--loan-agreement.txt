“Authorized Allocation” means an amount equivalent to 
$50,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and 
deposited into the Special Account pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Annex; provided, however, that 
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized 
Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to 
$25,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals 
from the Loan Account, plus the total amount of all 
outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions, shall equal or exceed the equivalent of 
$100,000,000.

2. Withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and

Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized 
Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a 
request or requests for deposit into the Special 
Account of an amount or amounts which in the aggregate 
do not exceed the Authorized Allocation. On the basis 
of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit 
into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested.

(b) For replenishment of the Special Account, 
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 
deposit into the Special Account at such intervals as 
the Bank shall specify. Prior to or at the time of 
each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to Part B.3 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement 
for the payment or payments in respect of which 
replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such 
request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said 
documents and other evidence to have been paid out of 
the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures. Each 
such deposit into the Special Account shall be 
withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under one 
or more of the Eligible Categories.



3. The Bank shall not be required to make further 
deposits into the Special Account, once the total 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan, minus the total amount 
of all outstanding special commitments entered into by 
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, 
withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such 
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit 
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice 
will be utilized in making payments for Eligible 
Expenditures.

Annex B to SCHEDULE 1

Operation of Special Account When Withdrawals Are 
Made On the Basis of Project Management Reports

1. Except as the Bank may otherwise specify by 
notice to the Borrower, all withdrawals from the Loan 
Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the 
Special Account in accordance with the provisions of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement.  Each such deposit into 
the Special Account shall be withdrawn by the Bank 
from the Loan Account under one or more of the 
Eligible Categories.

2. Each application for withdrawal from the Loan 
Account for deposit into the Special Account shall be 
supported by a Project Management Report.

3. Upon receipt of each application for withdrawal 
of an amount of the Loan, the Bank shall, on behalf of 
the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and 
deposit into the Special Account an amount equal to 
the lesser of: (a) the amount so requested; and (b) 
the amount which the Bank has determined, based on the 
Project Management Report accompanying said 
application, is required to be deposited in order to 
finance Eligible Expenditures during the six-month 
period following the date of such report; provided, 
however, that the amount so deposited, when added to 
the amount indicated by said Project Management Report 
to be remaining in the Special Account, shall not 
exceed the equivalent of $100,000,000.
