7. Interest Periods 

The period for which an Advance is outstanding shall be divided into successive periods each 

of which (other than the first) shall start on the last day of the preceding such period. For the

Part 5 

INTEREST RATES 

9. Interest 

9.1 On the last day of each Interest Period the Borrower shall pay accrued interest on the Advance 

to which such Interest Period relates. 

9.2 The rate of interest applicable to an Advance from time to time during an Interest Period 

relating thereto shall be the simple rate per annum which is the sum of the Margin and LIBOR on the 

Quotation Date therefor. 

16. Alternative Interest Rates 

10.1 In relation to any Advance and any Interest Period relating thereto: 

(i) if (out only if) LIBOR for such Advance would, but for this provision, be determined 

in accordance with paragraph (ii) of the definition thereof, the Agent determines that 

at or about 11.00 a.m. on the Quotation Date for such Interest Period none of the 

Reference Banks was offering to prime banks in the London Interbank Market 

deposits in dollars for the proposed duration of such Interest Period; or 

(ii) if before the close of business in London on the Quotation Date for such Interest 

Period, the Agent has been notified by a Bank or each of a group of Banks to whom 

in aggregate sixty-seven per cent. or more of the amount of the Loan is (or, if an 

Advance were then made, would be) owed that LIBOR for such Advance (whether 

determined in accordance with paragraph (i) or (ii) of the definition thereof) does not 

accurately reflect the cost to it of obtaining such deposits. 

then, notwithstanding the provisions of Clauses 7, 8 and 9: 

(a) if paragraph (i) above applies, the duration of that Interest Period shall be one month 

or, if less, such that it shall end on the next succeeding Repayment Date; and 

(b) if paragraph (i) or (ii) above applies, the rate of interest applicable to such Advance 

from time to time during such Interest Period shall be the rate per annum which is 

the sum of the Margin and the rate per annum determined by the Agent to be the 

weighted arithmetic average (rounded upwards, if not already such a multiple, to the 

nearest whole multiple of one-sixteenth of one per cent.) of the rates notified by each 

Bank to the Agent before the last day of such Interest Period to be those which 

express aS a percentage rate per annum the cost to each Bank of funding from 

whatever sources it may select its portion of such Advance during such Interest 

Period (and, in determining such weighted arithmetic average, the Agent shall, in its 

calculations, make due allowance for the relative size of each Bank’s participation in 

such Advance in relation to each Bank’s respective cost of funding as aforesaid); 

Provided Always that: 

-13-   
  

 



  

  

  

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

each Bank which notifies a rate to the Agent pursuant to this sub-paragraph 

(b) shall confirm therein, for the benefit cf the Borrowez, that in choosing its 

sources for the funding of its portion of such Advance during such Interest 

Period it has acted in a manner which is fair and reasonable in the 

circumstances and which does not adversely differ, in any material respect, 

with its actions in relation to other comparable extensions of credit by it (if 

any) which have, on or about the same time and date, been similarly affected: 

if, at any time during an Interest Period for an Advance to which the 

foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph (b) apply the Agent determines, 

after consultation with the Banks and the Borrower, and notifies the Banks 

and the Borrower that it has become possible (without any Bank thereby 

incurring any funding or analogous cose vu capeuscs im reiation to the 

alternative sources of funding it may have already utilised in relation thereto) 

(A) in the case of paragraph (i) above, to establish and apply the rate per 

annum equal to LIBOR for the remaining part of such Interest Period or (B) 

in the case of paragraph (ii) above, for each of the Banks who have given a 

notification pursuant thereto (or such of them as have not been prepaid 

pursuant to Clause 12.4 or have been the subject of a transfer pursuant to 
Clause 12.7) to recover the cost of funding their respective portions of such 

Advance for the remaining part of such Interest Period by establishing and 

applying the rate per annum equal to LIBOR in relation thereto, then as and 

from the third business day from but exclusive of the date of the Agent’s 

determination and notification as aforesaid (or such earlier date as imay be 

agreed between the Banks, the Agent and the Borrower) the rate of interest 

applicable to such Advance for the remaining part of such Interest Period 
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 7, 8 and 9 

as if the remaining part of such Interest Period were a separate Interest 

Period but, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest which has already 

accrued in re!siion to such Advance pursuant to the foregoing provisions of 

this sub-paragraph (b) shall only be payable by the Borrower at the end of the 

remaining part of such Interest Period together with the other interest due in 

relation to such Advance and that Interest Period; 

in relation to any Advance or Advances to which sub-paragraph (ii) above 

applies, the maximum aggregate period of time (on any one or more 

occasions, whether consecutive or not) for which a rate of interest can be 

established pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph (b) in 

respect of all such Advances shall not exceed six months and, in relation to 

any remaining part of any Interest Period for any Advance to which the 

foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph (b) cannot be applied by virtue of 
such time limitation, the rate of interest therefor shall thereafter be 

determined in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 7, 8 and 9 as if the 

remaining part of such Interest Period were a separate Interest Period but, for 

the avoidance of doubt any interest which has already accrued in relation to 

such Advance pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph (b) 
shall only be payable by the Borrower at the end of such Interest Period

together with the other interest due in relation to such Advance and that 

Interest Period; and 

(4) if, in relation to a Advance, all of the Banks who have given a notification 

pursuant to paragraph (ii) above in respect of such Advance have (A) been 

prepaid in full by the Borrower pursuant to Clause 12.4 and/or (B) been the 

subject of a completed Transfer Certificate pursuant to Clause 12.7, then, if 

such prepayment/transfer occurs during the continuance of an Interest Period 

to which the foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph (b) are applied, as at 

and from but exclusive of the date of such prepayment/transfer (but cnly so 

long as it would not involve any remaining Bank thereby incurring any 

funding or analogous costs or expenses in relation to the alternative sources 

of funding it may have already utilised in relation thereto), the rate of interest 

applicable to such Advance for the remaining part of such Interest Period 

shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 7, 8 and 9 

as if the remaining part of such Interest Period were a separate Interest 

Period but, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest which has accrued in 

relation to that Advance pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this 

sub-paragraph (b) shall only be payable at the end of the remaining part of 

such Interest Period together with the other interest due in relation to such 

Advance and that Interest Period. 

10.2 If (i) either of those events mentioned at paragraphs (i) and (ii) in Clause 10.1 occurs 

" or (ii) irrespective as to th basis on which LIBOR is to be determined for the purposes of this 

Agreement, by reason of circumstances affecting the London Interbank Market during any period of 

five consecutive business days none of the Reference Banks offers deposits in doilars to prime banks 

in the London Interbank Market, then: 

(a) 

(b) 

the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks of such event (and, in the event 

of the occurrence of the circumstances described in paragraph (ii) above, the Agent 

shall certify in its notification to the Borrower that it is of the opinion, after 

consultation with the Banks, that the circumstances in question are not likely to be 

past or otherwise ceased to be relevant by the next succeeding Repayment Date); and 

if the Agent so requires, within five days of such notification the Agent and the 

Borrower shall enter into negotiations with a view to agreeing a substitute basis 

(1) for determining the rates of interest from time to time applicable to the Advances 

and/or (2) upon which the Advances may be maintained (whether in dollars or some 

other currency) thereafter and any such substitute basis that is agreed shall take effect 

in accordance with its terms and be binding on each party hereto; Provided Always 

that the Agent may not agree any such substitute basis without the prior consent of 

each Bank.

5. Based on and subject to the foregoing and subject to the qualifications expressed in paragraph 

6 below and any matters not disclosed to us by the parties concerned, we are of the opinions that: 

The Borrower has the power to enter into the Facility Agreement and to exercise its 

tights and perform its obligations thereunder, and has taken all necessary action to 

authorise the borrowing under the Agreement and the performance of the Borrower’s 

obligations thereunder. The Facility Agreement has been duly executed and delivered 

by the Borrower. 

The Facility Agreement constitutes valid and legally binding obligations of the 

Borrower enforceable in accordance with its terms. 

The obligations of the Borrower under the Facility Agreement are direct, 

unconditional and general obligations of the Borrower and rank at least equally and 

rateably (pari passu) in point of priority and security with all other unsecured and 

non-subordinated obligations of the Borrower. 

The Facility Agreement has been duly authorised by all the relevant governmental 

authorities of China, neither the execution and delivery thereof nor the consummation 

of the transactions contemplated thereby nor compliance by the Borrower with any 

of the terms and provisions thereof will <i) contravene any existing law, judgment, 

govermental rule, regulation or order applicable to or binding on the Borrower or 

(ii) the constitution of China. 

It is not necessary to file, register or record the Facility Agreement in any public 

office in China to ensure the legality, validity or enforceability of the Facility 

Agreement. 

The Borrower will not be obliged to make any deduction from or withholding of any 

portion of any payment which is to be made to the Finance Parties under the Facility 

Agreement on account of any tax imposed by China. 

Neither the Borrower nor its property has any right of immunity from judicial 

proceedings, attachment or execution of judgment in China on the grounds of 

sovereignty or otherwise in respect of any claims arising out of its obligations under 

the Facility Agreement. 

The choice of English law to govern the Facility Agreement is a valid choice and 

English law would be applied by the courts of China in any proceedings brought in 

connection with the Agreement except to the extent that English law was contrary to 

the public policy of China. 

The irrevocable submission by the Borrower to the jurisdiction of the courts referred 

to in Clause 44 of the Facility Agreement is valid and binding. 

Any final and conclusive judgment of the courts of England would be recognised and 

enforced in the courts of China subject to the requirements of Articles 267 and 268 

of the Civil Procedure Law of China adopted on April 9, 1991; namely:

(1) 

Article 267 - If a legally effective judgment or ruling of a foreign court requires 

recognition and enforcement by a people’s court, the party concerned may apply 

directly to an intermediate people’s court of the People’s Republic of China with 

jurisdiction over the case for recognition and enforcement, or the foreign court may, 

in accordance with the provisions of international treaties concluded or acceded to by 

the said country and the People’s Republic of China or according to the principle of 

reciprocity, request that the people’s court recognise and enforce the said judgment 

or ruling. 

Article 268 - After a people’s court has reviewed, in accordance with the provisions 

of international treaties concluded or acceded to the People’s Republic of China or 

according to the principle of reciprocity, a legally effective judgment or ruling of a 

foreign court requiring recognition and enforcement by the People’s Republic of 

China, if it considers that the judgment or ruling does not violate the basic princinlec 

of the law of the People’s Republic of China and its sovereignty, security or social 

and public interest, the people’s court shall rule to recognise its validity. If execution 

of the judgment or ruling is required, an execution order shall be issued and enforced 

pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Law. If found to violate the basic 

principles of the law of the People’s Republic of China or its sovereignty, security 

or social and public interest, the people’s court shall refuse to allow its recognition 

and enforcement. 

It is not necessary or advisable for any Finance Party to become registered or have 

a piace of business in China (i) by reason only of its entering into the Facility 

Agreement and performing their respective obligations thereunder or (ii) in order to 

enforce any of the provisions of the Facility Agreement against the Borrower in 

China; and 

No stamp duty will be payable in respect of the execution, delivery and enforcement 

of the Facility Agreement. 

6. The qualifications to which this opinion is subject are that all remedies provided in the Facility 

Agreement may be limited by:

property, repayments shall be made in the following order: 

(i) wages owed to employees of the bankrupt enterprise and labour insurance 

premiums; 

(ii) outstanding tax payments. 

7. The opinions expressed herein are confined to and given on the basis of the laws of China as 

currently applied by the Chinese courts. We have made no investigation of the laws of any 

jurisdiction other than China and we do not express or imply any opinion thereon. This opinion is 

governed by and shall be construed in accordance with Chinese law. 

8. This opinion is addressed to you solely for your own use in connection with the transaction 

contemplated by the Facility Agreement and may not be disclosed in whole or in part to any other 

person or otherwise relied upon for any other purpose without our express prior written consent (save 

that it may be disclosed to and relied upon by IBRD and your English legal counsel).

THE SEVENTH SCHEDULE 

Form of Opinion of General Counsel to IBRD 

From : IBRD General Legal Counsel 

[address] 

To : Dresdner (South East Asia) Limited 

as agent on its own behalf and for and on behalf of the Managers 

and the Banks referred to in the Facility Agreement mentioned below 

[ ], 1994 

Dear Sirs 

1. I refer to the loan and guarantee agreement (the "Loan Agreement”) dated [ ], 

1994 and made between the People’s Republic of China as Borrower, the International Bank for 

Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD") as partial guarantor, BOT International (H.K.) Limited, 

Dresdner (South East Asia) Limited and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York as 

Arrangers, the financial institutions named therein as Lead Managers, the financial institutions named 

therein as Managers, the financial institutions named therein as Co-Managers, the financial institutions 

named therein as the Banks and Dresdner (South East Asia) Limited as Agent. 

2. I have reviewed the proceedings of IBRD to authorise the involvement by IBRD as partial 

guarantor on the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement and, in connection with such 

review, I have examined among other things, the following: 

(a) the Articles of Agreement, By-laws and Rules of Procedure for meetings of the 

Executive Directors of IBRD; 

(b) the minutes of the meeting of the Executive Directors of IBRD held on [ ] May, 

1994 at which action was taken to record the approval of the Executive Directors on 

[ ] May, 1994 of IBRD’s said involvement as partial guarantor; 

(c) the approval and agreement of each member of IBRD required under Section 1(>) of 

Article IV of said Articles of Agreement for the partial guarantee of IBRD under the 

Loan Agreement; 

(d) the Resolution, dated [ ] December, 1991, authorising [ ] 

of IBRD to sign in the name and on behalf of IBRD any instrument or document in 

connection with IBRD's said involvement as partial guarantor; and 

(e) the Loan Agreement.

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5)   
(6) 

(7) 

  

3. Based upon the foregoing and such legal considerations as I deem relevant, I am of the 

opinion that: 

IBRD is an international institution duly established and existing under Articles of 

Agreement drawn up by the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held 

at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in July 1944. 

IBRD has the power, authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan 

Agreement and to comply with the provisions thereof and the Loan Agreement has 

been duly authcrised, executed and delivered by IBRD. 

The Loan Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of IBRD in 

accordance with its terms (insofar as the terms of the Loan Agreement apply to 

IBRD), and the obligations of IBRD thereunder rank at least pari passu with all the 

direct and contingent liabilities of IBRD. 

All consents (including any internal consents of IBRD), approvals, authorisations, 

filings or registrations required by or of IBRD in connection with the execution and 

delivery of the Loan Agreement and the performance by IBRD of its obligations 

thereunder have been obtained and are in full force and effect and such execution, 

delivery and performance does not and will not (i) require any further consent, 

approval or authorisation of, or any ratification by, or any filing, registration or 

qualification with, any person in each case under present laws and regulations or (ii) 

violate any provision of IBRD’s Articles of Agreement or By-Laws or any law, rule 

or regulation or of any order, judgment, injunction, decree, resolution, determination 

or award of any court or arbitrator or any judicial, administrative or governmental 

authority or organisation, in each case presently in effect having applicability to 

IBRD. 

IBRD has full juridical personality with capacity to make contracts, to acquire and 

dispose of property and to sue and be sued. 

The obligations of IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee are entitled to the benefits of 

Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of IBRD and, with respect to any action 

brought by any of the Banks or the Agent in any of the courts specified in Clause 26 

of the Loan Agreement in connection with any of IBRD’s obligations under the IBRD | 

Guarantee, IBRD has no immunity from any legal action, suit or proceeding, in, or 

jurisdiction of, any such court or any legal process (whether service or notice, set-off, 

attachment or seizure in aid of execution of judgment, or execution of judgment) with 

respect to itself or any of its property or assets and to the extent any such immur’ty 

is ascribed to it IBRD has waived it; provided, however, that the property and assets 

of IBRD shall, wheresoever located and by whomsoever held, be immune from all 

forms of seizure, attachment or execution before the delivery of final judgment 

against IBRD as provided in said Article VII. The appointment of the process agents 

of IBRD pursuant to Clause 26.2 of the Loan Agreement is valid and effective. 

Under IBRD’s Articles of Agreement, the IBRD Guarantee and payments made 

thereunder are not subject to any tax by a member of IBRD (i) which tax 

  

 



  

  

  

(8) 

discriminates against such IBRD Guarantee and payments made thereunder solely 
because such IBRD Guarantee was issued by IBRD or (ii) if the sole jurisdictional 

basis for the tax is the place or currency in which such IBRD Guarantee was issued, 

or in which obligations thereunder are made payable or paid, or the location of any 

office or place of business maintained by IBRD. 

The execution and delivery of the Loan Agreement and the performance by IBRD of 

its obligations thereunder will not violate, result in a breach of, or constitute a default 

under, any provision of any indenture, contract or other undertaking to which IBRD 

is a party or by which it or its property is bound or, to the best of my knowledge, 

of any law applicable to it. 

Yours faithfully
