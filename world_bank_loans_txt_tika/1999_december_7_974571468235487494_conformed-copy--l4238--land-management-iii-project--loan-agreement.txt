SCHEDULE 2

Description of the Project

The objectives of the Project are to increase and sustain agricultural 
production and productivity, and farm income and to assist in the conservation of 
natural resources in the Project Area by: (a) promoting the adoption of sustainable 
forms of land management and soil, water and forest conservation, at the 
Microcatchment level, involving the farming community in natural resources planning, 
use and monitoring; (b) developing community environmental awareness and participation 
in environmental protection efforts; (c) increasing the extent and duration of 
vegetative cover to the soil; and (d) improving internal soil structure and drainage, 
and safely disposing of any remaining agro-chemichal run-off, either within or outside 
farm boundaries.

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 
thereof as the Bank and the Borrower may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives:

Part A: Adaptive Agricultural Research

Strengthening of SAA’s adaptive research capacity on improved management of 
natural resources, soil structure and vegetative cover, through the carrying out of 
research trials identified by farmers or group of farmers located in the Project Area 
on the development of, inter alia, soil conservation practices, erosion control 
methods, land use rationalization, crop diversification, agroforestry systems, 
agricultural input use rationalization, integrated pest management, pasture 
rehabilitation, and sustainable systems for small farmers.

Part B: Technology and Institutional Development

Strengthening the provision of extension services to assist Microcatchment land 
users in the Project Area to improve their natural resource management and soil work 
on forest conservation practices through:

1. Mobilization of about 300 senior extensionists at the municipal level and 
acquisition and utilization of vehicles, equipment and furniture; and

2. Provision of extension services to about 90,000 farmers in consultant 
Microcatchments in the Project Area to assist them in:

(a) organizing and establishing a farmer association within each 
Microcatchment in the Project Area which participates in the carrying out of the 
Project;

(b) carrying out of land use mapping as the basis for the preparation of land 
management soil conservation plans for each Microcatchment;

(c) preparing, with the participation of the corresponding farmer 
association, a land management and soil conservation plan for each Microcatchment, 
complemented, where necessary, with individual farm plans for small-scale farmers; and



(d) preparing applications for Microcatchment Subprojects.

Part C: Program for Land Management, Soil Conservation, and Pollution Control and
Reforestation

1. Carrying out of environmental education activities including: (a) preparation of 
an operational strategy for environmental education based on a participatory 
methodology; and (b) training, seminars and workshops on natural resources management, 
in particular with respect to the management of the relevant Microcatchment.

2. Provision of Grants to farmers or group of farmers in the Project Area for the 
purposes  of carrying out Microcatchment Subprojects, consisting of: (a) application 
of technologies for improving the management and quality of river water; and (b) the 
development and expansion of the Borrower’s reforestation program through the 
distribution of seedlings of native species for planting by Microcatchment farmers of

of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c) the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount equivalent to 
$4,000,000, or such other amount as the Bank shall establish, to be withdrawn from the 
Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of 
this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, the 
Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to $2,000,000 until the 
aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all 
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of 
the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed an amount equivalent to $8,000,000.

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account 
at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is requested.  On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan 



Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as the

said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower

documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further

Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into

Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be 
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished 
to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account 
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall 
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, 
as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
