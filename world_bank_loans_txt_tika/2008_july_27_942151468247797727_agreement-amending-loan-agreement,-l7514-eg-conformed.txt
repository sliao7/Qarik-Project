ANNEX 2 
 

SCHEDULE 3 
 

A. Amortization Schedule for the Initial Loan 
 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Initial Loan and 
the percentage of the total principal amount of the Initial Loan payable on each Principal 
Payment Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Initial Loan shall have been 
fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Initial 
Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of the Initial Loan withdrawn and 
outstanding as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each 
Principal Payment Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct 
any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 
 

Payment Date 
Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 
 

On each February 1 and August 1 
Beginning August 1, 2009 
through August 1, 2020 
 

4.17% 

On February 1, 2021 4.09%

2. If the proceeds of the Initial Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Initial Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

 
(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Initial Loan shall have been 

withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount 
withdrawn and outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule. 

 
(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original 



- 9 -

Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 

if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 
 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the 
Initial Loan to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved 
Currency that shall be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the 
Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable 
by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if 
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate 
component of the Screen Rate. 
 
5. If the principal amount of the Initial Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time 
to time shall be denominated in more than one Initial Loan Currency, the provisions of 
this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Initial Loan 
Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

B. Amortization Schedule for the Additional Loan 
 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Additional 
Loan and the percentage of the total principal amount of the Additional Loan payable on 
each Principal Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Additional 
Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal 
amount of the Additional Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment 
Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Additional Loan 
Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each 
Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct 
any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 

 

Principal Payment Date 
Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 
 

On each February 1 and August 1 
Beginning August 1, 2013 
through February 1, 2038 

2.00% 

2. If the proceeds of the Additional Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Additional Loan repayable by 
the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Additional Loan have been 
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the 
Withdrawn Additional Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of 
this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 
in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment 
Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable 
to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

 
3. (a) Amounts of the Additional Loan withdrawn within two calendar months 
prior to any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and 



- 11 -

shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Additional Loan Balance to 
an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall 
be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 
immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate. 
 
5. If the Withdrawn Additional Loan Balance is denominated in more than one 
Additional Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the 
amount denominated in each Additional Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate 
amortization schedule for each such amount.
