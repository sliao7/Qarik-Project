(the Small Farmers) including those of women, youth, and indigenous peoples by:  

 

(a)  implementing small sustainable and competitive business investments 

(Farmers’ Business Initiatives) through grants (the Grants) aimed at 

increasing Small Farmers’ competitiveness (productivity, quality, value 

added and marketing) while improving environmentally-sound 

agricultural practices; and  

 

(b)  strengthening producers’ organization regarding agricultural 

competitiveness through information and training programs to stimulate 

the emergence of business ideas in targeted municipalities and micro-

catchments in the Borrower’s territory, by providing technical assistance 

for the preparation of business proposals to be funded for Farmers’ 

Business Initiatives under the Grants (market analysis, feasibility 

assessments, assistance to informal groups to constitute formal 

organizations, inter alia), as well as by providing technical assistance on 

organizational, financial, marketing, implementation and monitoring 

issues under Farmers’ Business Initiatives. 

 

Component 2. Strengthening Institutional and Physical Infrastructure 

 

Provide support to the Borrower’s functions that are critical to the 

competitiveness and sustainability of family farming in its territory through investments 

in:  

(a)   monitoring policy frameworks, markets and rural extension through 

studies and workshops to improve regulation and incentive systems for 

family farming competitiveness (labeling systems, and analysis of 

specific supply-chains, inter alia), the setting-up of an online agri-

business information center, and the strengthening the capacity of CATI 

to advise Small Farmers on production technologies, marketing and 



 

- 7 - 

 

management at central, regional and municipal levels through the 

provision of training and equipment; 

 

(b)  rehabilitating and maintaining municipal rural roads in the Borrower’s 

territory to help facilitate Small Farmers’ physical access to markets 

through assistance to the Borrower’s municipalities to prepare simple 

rural road management programs, financing of grants (when minimum 

levels of technical, institutional and financial sustainability are met) for 

infrastructure subprojects (Infrastructure Subprojects) to support 

rehabilitation and maintenance of priority sections of rural roads as 

identified in the rural road management programs so as to ensure all-year 

usability, and supporting units of production of small paving materials; 

and 

 

(c)  promoting environmental sustainability through the mainstreaming of 

improved environmental practices in rural production systems to ensure 

the sustainability of the productive resource-base (land and water) by 

supporting pilot subprojects at farm-level (Environmental Subprojects), 

implementation of the Borrower’s environmental compliance system  in 

rural areas combined with environmental awareness-raising, and the 

carrying out of the Borrower’s new program of payments for 

environmental services to rural areas. 

 

Component 3. Project Management 

 

Provide support to the Borrower to efficiently and effectively implement, 

administer, supervise, and coordinate all the activities carried out under the Project by 

financing the institutional structures, equipment and personnel required to manage 

Project activities, including fiduciary functions (procurement, accounting and financial 

management) as well as technical planning, implementation of social and environmental 

safeguard instruments, monitoring and evaluation, dissemination of Project results and

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 

Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if

invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 

withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 

Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

 

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for
