(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish

pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On 
the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the

additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account 
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount

be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, 
as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 



portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
