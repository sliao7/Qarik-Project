SCHEDULE 3

Amortization Schedule

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the
Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be
determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the
first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

Installment Share

Principal Payment Date (Expressed as a Percentage)

On each May15 and November 15 2.13%
Beginning on May 15, 2020
through November 15, 2042

On May 15, 2043 2.02%

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of
the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I
of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.



- 24 -

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the

principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as

withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date

following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment

Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which

invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any

withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion

Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for

each such amount.
