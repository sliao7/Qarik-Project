(b) In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with 

this Part A and Part C.2 of this Section, the Borrower shall use the 

relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such

estimated to cost the equivalent of $5,000,000 or more. 

Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures 

described in Part A.1 of this Section, goods manufactured in Uruguay

2. Computer equipment estimated to cost the equivalent of 

$100,000 or more per bid package, and to be financed out of the

procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the 

Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be
