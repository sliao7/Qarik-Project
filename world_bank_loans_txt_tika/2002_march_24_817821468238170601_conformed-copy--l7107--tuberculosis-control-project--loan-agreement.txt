SCHEDULE 3



Amortization Schedule

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date 
(Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn two months 
prior to the first Principal Payment Date (the current billing system pursuant to Section 3(a) of 
this Schedule), the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of 
the Loan withdrawn and outstanding two months prior to the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as 
necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a 
Currency Conversion applies. The principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding two 
months prior to the first Principal Payment Date shall be the aggregate amount of the Loan 
withdrawn from the Loan Account up to July 15, 2010, minus the aggregate amounts prepaid by 
the Borrower up to July 15, 2010, in accordance with Section 2.02 of the Tripartite Arrangement. 

Installment Share
Payment Date (Expressed as a %)

On each 15 September and 15 March
Beginning 15 September 2010 
   through 15 September 2021 4.17%

On 15 March 2022      4.09%

2. If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn two months prior to the 
first Principal Payment Date, the total principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower 
on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn two 
months prior to the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn 
and outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

(b) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn in the 
six-month period commencing on the date falling two (2) months prior to the first Principal 
Payment Date and ending on the date falling four (4) months after the first Principal Payment 
Date or in any subsequent six-month period (in each case commencing on a date falling two (2) 
months prior to any Principal Payment Date and ending on a date falling four (4) months after 
such Principal Payment Date), the Borrower shall repay the Net Repayment Amount (as the term 
is defined below) in respect of such six (6) month period, if any,  on each Principal Payment Date 
after the period for which such Net Repayment Amount has been determined by the Bank by 
multiplying the relevant Net Repayment Amount by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said 
Principal Payment Date (the Original Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be 



the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling after the 
period for which such Net Repayment Amount is determined. The repayment amounts so 
calculated to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. For purposes of this paragraph the term “Net 
Repayment Amount” means the aggregate of all withdrawals from the Loan Account made in any 
six-month period consisting of the two months immediately prior to and the four months 
immediately following any Principal Payment Date minus the amount prepaid by the Borrower in 
accordance with Section 2.02 of the Tripartite Arrangement during the same six-month period.

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal Payment 
Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal 
Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of  withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if at any 
time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after 
the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer 
apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 

4. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time shall be 
denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply 
separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate 
amortization schedule for each such amount.
