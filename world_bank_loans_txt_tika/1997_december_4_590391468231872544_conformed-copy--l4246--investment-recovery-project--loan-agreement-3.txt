SCHEDULE 4

Special Account

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of 
payments on account of withdrawals made by a Beneficiary under a Sub-loan to meet the 
reasonable cost of goods, works and services required for Sub-projects and to be 
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, provided, however, that notwithstanding the 
provisions of paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement, payments for expenditures 
to be financed out of the proceeds of free-limit Sub-loans may be made out of the 
Special Account before the Bank shall have authorized withdrawals from the Loan 
Account in respect thereof. Such expenditures, however, shall qualify as eligible 
expenditures only if the Bank shall subsequently authorize such withdrawals; and

(b) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to 
DEM 1,300,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the Special 
Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless 
the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 
amount equivalent to DEM 650,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the 
Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or 
exceed the equivalent of DEM 2,000,000. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the 
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have 
requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the 

Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence 

required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested.  On the basis 
of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,  
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account 
such amount as the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have 
been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been 

paid out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account and in the 
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and 
other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower 



shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the 
period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit 
reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account; or

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals 
from the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General 
Conditions; or

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan, less the amount of any 
outstanding special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of 
the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of 
twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that 
the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the 
Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for 
eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished 
to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account 
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall 
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, 
as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.

SCHEDULE 5 

Modifications of the General Conditions

For purposes of this Agreement, the provisions of the General Conditions are 
modified to read as follows:

Section 6.03 is modified to read:



“Section 6.03. Cancellation by the Bank.  If: (a) the right of the 
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account shall have been suspended 
with respect to any amount of the Loan for a continuous period of thirty (30) days; 
or (b) at any time, the Bank determines, after consultation with the Borrower, 
that an amount of the Loan will not be required to finance the Project’s costs to be 
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan; or (c) at any time, the Bank 
determines, with respect to any contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the 
Loan, that corrupt or fraudulent practices were engaged in by representatives of the 
Borrower or of a beneficiary of the Loan during the procurement or the execution of 
such contract, without the Borrower having taken timely and appropriate action 
satisfactory to the Bank to remedy the situation, and establishes the amount of 
expenditures in respect or such contract which would otherwise have been eligible for 
financing out of the proceeds of the Loan; or (d) at any time, the Bank determines 
that the procurement of any contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the 
Loan is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to in the Loan 
Agreement and establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of such contract 
which would otherwise have been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the 
Loan; or (e) after the Closing Date, an amount of the Loan shall remain 
unwithdrawn from the Loan Account; or (f) by the date specified in paragraph C.2 (c) 
of Schedule 6 to the Loan Agreement, the Bank shall, in respect of any portion of the 
Loan: (i) have received no applications or requests permitted under subparagraphs 
(a) or (b) of said paragraph; or (ii) have denied any such applications or requests, 
the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, terminate the right to submit such 
applications or approvals or to make withdrawals from the Loan Account, as the 
case may be, with respect to such amount or portion of the Loan.  Upon the giving 
of such notice, such amount or portion of the Loan shall be canceled.”
