Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, (x) the 
Authorized Allocation for the Inner Mongolia Special Account shall be limited to an 
amount equal to $3,000,000, until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan 
Account allocated to Category 1 plus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions for Part A of the Project shall be equal to or exceed $25,000,000; (y) the

Project shall be equal to or exceed $17,000,000.

2. Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made exclusively for eligible

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that any Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation in respect of such 
Special Account and subsequent withdrawals to replenish such  Special Account shall be 
made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the relevant Special Account such amount or 
amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account 
at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to para�graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 
have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the 
Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in 



the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of any Special Account, the Borrower 
shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into any Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the 
period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit 
reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for such Special Account;

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals 
from the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General 
Conditions; or

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Category for the Part of the Project in respect of which such Special Account was 
established,  minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered 
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to 
such Part of the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocation in respect of such Special Account. Thereafter, withdrawal from 
the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the 
eligible Category for such Part of the Project shall follow such procedures as the 
Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made 
only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such 
amounts remaining on deposit in such Special Account as of the date of such notice 
will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of any 
Special Account: 

(i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or

(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:

(A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or

(B) deposit into such Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so 
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of 
such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further 
deposit by the Bank into such Special Account shall be 
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made 
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in any Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in any Special Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 



this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
