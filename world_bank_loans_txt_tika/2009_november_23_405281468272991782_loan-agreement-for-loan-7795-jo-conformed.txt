RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (“Bank”) for the purpose of providing 
financing in support of the Program (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).  The 
Bank has decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions 
which the Borrower has already taken under the Program and which are described in 
Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower’s maintenance of an 
appropriate macro-economic policy framework. The Borrower and the Bank therefore 
hereby agree as follows:

a Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this

2.04. The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate 

equal to LIBOR for the Loan Currency plus the Variable Spread; provided, that 
upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the 
interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on such amount 



2

shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of 
the General Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-payment 
continues for a period of thirty days, then the interest payable by the Borrower 
shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 (d) of the General

a sound framework that identifies the rationale for said tax exemptions, as well as 
consider the costs of the foregone revenues, and establish a specified duration for the tax

reduced by at least 4.0 percentage points of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in 
accordance with the revised 2009 Budget Circular; and (ii) a comprehensive policy 
framework that includes stable wage and salary expenditures in terms of GDP compared 
to the fiscal years 2008-2009, and the termination of the remaining subsidies for oil

lower budget deficit before any grants by at least 1.0 percentage point of GDP in 2010 
over 2009. 
 
3. The Borrower’s Ministry of Finance has adopted an enhanced budget calendar to 
strengthen the initial strategic phase of budget preparation, and such calendar shall guide 
the review of budget performance, budget strategies and budget priorities as well as the 
evaluation of medium-term spending requirements, and shall set forth provisions for 
Cabinet level consultations in the first quarter of each fiscal year on key parameters and 
issues underlying the development of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework 
(MTEF) based on a Budget Policies and Priorities Paper.

6. The Borrower’s Cabinet has approved a draft Company Law that: (i) abolishes the

members of the Social Security Corporation, which benefits consist of: (a) a flexible 
mechanism of unemployment insurance savings accounts financed by contributions from 
employers and employees; (ii) the use of balances in savings accounts or borrowing from 
accumulated pension rights with limits to be determined by regulation; and (iii) coverage 
for all Social Security Corporation members after a minimum vesting period to be

SCHEDULE 2 
 

Amortization Schedule 
 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

 

Principal Payment Date 
Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 
 

On each May 15 and November 15 
 Beginning May 15, 2015 
 through May 15,  2029 

 

3.33% 
 

On November 15, 2029 3.43% 
 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 
in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment 
Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable 
to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 



10

second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable 
on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 
on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 
immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate.
