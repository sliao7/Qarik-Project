Section I. National Competitive Bidding

Goods estimated to cost less than $300,000 equivalent per contract and works 
estimated to cost less than $5,000,000 equivalent per contract, may be procured under 
contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding, subject to the following 
additional provisions: 
 

(a) Before issuing any invitation to bid, the Borrower shall use, or cause to 
be used, standard bidding documents, as approved by the Bank for 
bidding under the Project and incorporated in the Operational Manual 
(the “Standard Bidding Documents”). Any change or departure from the 
Standard Bidding Document approved by the Bank shall require its prior 
approval. 

 
(b) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or citizens of the 

Borrower’s territory, will be treated equally and, particularly, no 
preference will be granted to any bidder or group of bidders for bid 
evaluation purposes. Bidders shall be allowed to submit their bids by 
hand or through the post office or private mailing services. There shall 
not be any requirement for any bidder to show evidence of the bidder's 
registration in any public registry, chamber of commerce or similar 
entity, whether in the Borrower’s territory or elsewhere, or to appoint a 
representative domiciled in Borrower’s territory, unless and until such 
bidder is awarded the corresponding contract. 

 
(c) Bids shall be opened in a public meeting to which bidders and their 

representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and 
place for the opening meeting shall be set forth in the bidding 
documents. Bid opening shall coincide with, or take place promptly after, 
the final date and time of the period for bid submission stipulated in the 
bidding documents. 

 
(d) Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to 

the responsive bidder who meets appropriate technical and financial 
standards of capability and whose bid has been determined to be the 
lowest evaluated bid. Such determination shall be made exclusively on 
the basis of the specifications, conditions and evaluation criteria 
stipulated in the bidding documents. If any factor additional to the 



- 18 -

amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid evaluation, such 
factor or factors and the quantified manner on which they will be applied 
for purposes of determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely 
stipulated in the bidding documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and 
comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor shall 
be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, 
including correction of arithmetic errors. 

 
(e) The provisions of paragraph 2.46 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, 

more specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the 
persons officially charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating 
the bids while they are performing their official duties, without the 
corresponding bidder’s written authorization. Moreover, bidders shall not 
be required to provide such authorization as a condition to be entitled to 
bid. This confidentiality requirement shall apply until the award of 
contract is notified to the successful bidder. Thereafter, confidentiality of 
the bids shall be limited to those bid portions for which confidentiality 
has been specifically requested by the bidder in question. 

 
Section II. Shopping

Contracts for goods or works estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent per 
contract may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of Shopping subject to the 
following additional provisions: 
 

(a) The Borrower shall obtain and compare at least three quotations to 
establish reasonableness of price. Comparison of two quotations is 
justified only when there is evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that there 
are only two reliable sources of supply (national or foreign as the case 
may be). For international shopping, the Borrower shall request 
quotations of suppliers from at least two different countries, including 
the country of the Borrower. Quotation for foreign goods located in the 
Borrower’s country and offered by a firm located in the Borrower’s 
country, are considered as quoted from abroad for purposes of satisfying 
the “two different countries” rule. 

 
(b) The Borrower shall verify that the firms invited to quote are reputable, 

well established, and are suppliers of the goods or services being 
purchased as part of their normal business. 

 
(c) The Borrower shall request quotations by letter, fax, telex, electronic 

messaging, etc., (with proof of receipt and record keeping). Since 
quotation requests must be sent to reputable and well-established 
suppliers only, the requests should not be open to any other supplier and 
should not be made public. Suppliers shall submit their quotations in 



- 19 -

writing, (i.e., by fax, telex, letter, or electronic messaging with copies to 
be kept for the records).  No bid security is required.  There is no 
requirement for strict time and date for submission of quotations and for 
public opening, but normally requests for quotes indicate the expected 
date of submission of quotes, within one or two weeks of the initial 
request.

Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies.

each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

 
(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 

the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such 
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original 
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 



- 21 -

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
