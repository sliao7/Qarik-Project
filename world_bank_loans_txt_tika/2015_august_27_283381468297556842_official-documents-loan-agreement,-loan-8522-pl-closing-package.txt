SCHEDULE 2 

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the percentage 
of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date 
(“Installment Share”). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment 
Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, 
to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

  

Principal Payment Date Installment Share 
(Expressed as a Percentage) 

  

On each May I5and November 15 
Beginning May 15, 2025 
through November 15, 2044 2,44% 
    On May 15, 2045 2,40%     
  

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment 
Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as 
of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph | of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 

(a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding 
on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall 
be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.



(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub- 
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency, 
the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal 
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the 
Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the 
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating 
to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan 
Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
