published on the web sites of the Public Procurement Bureau and respective 
ministry.  

 
• Time allowed for the preparation and submission of bids shall not be less

law and are not a dependent agency of the contracting authority. Furthermore, they will 
be subject to the same bid and performance security requirements as other bidders.  
 
(f) Bidding Documents 

Procuring entities shall use the appropriate standard bidding documents 
acceptable to the Bank for procurement of goods and works. 
 
(g) Bid Opening, Bid Evaluation and Contract Award

appropriate price adjustment clause.  
 
(j) Securities 

• Bid security and performance security should follow the generally accepted 
practice used in the local market.  

 
• Alternative methods such as bid securing declaration may be acceptable, in 

which case the Borrower may require bidders to sign a declaration accepting that 
if they withdraw or modify their bids during the period of validity or they are 
awarded the contract and they fail to sign the contract or to submit a performance 
security before the deadline defined in the bidding documents, the bidder will be 
suspended for bidding in any contract with the implementing uni

suppliers, contractors and subcontractors shall permit the Bank, at its request, to inspect 
their accounts and records relating to the procurement and performance of the contract 
and to have said accounts and records audited by auditors appointed by the Bank. The 



16 

 

deliberate and material violation by the supplier, contractor or subcontractor of such 
provision may amount to obstructive practice.

The Bank shall declare a firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or for a 
stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by the Bank, if it at any time determines 
that the firm or individual has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, 
fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in competing for, or in executing,

SCHEDULE 3 
 

Amortization Schedule 
 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the 
Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

 
Principal Payment Date Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage)

2.7% 

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

 
(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 

the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such 
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original 
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date[, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 



18 

 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
