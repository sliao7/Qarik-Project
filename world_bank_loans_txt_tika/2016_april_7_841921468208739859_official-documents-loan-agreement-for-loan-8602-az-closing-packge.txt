remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates

the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to

that is repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the
Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such
amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion
by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge
Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of
the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan
Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount
