of interest shall be ineligible for award of a contract. The provisions on conflict of

interest as stated under Section I of the Procurement Guidelines shall apply.

Eligibility

2. The eligibility of bidders shall be as defined under Section I of the Procurement

Guidelines; accordingly, no bidder or potential bidder shall be declared ineligible for

contracts financed by the Bank for reasons other than those provided in Section I of the

Guidelines. Foreign bidders shall be eligible to participate in bidding under the same

dependent agencies of the Borrower or Sub-Borrower.

Registration

be the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, shall be given reasonable opportunity of

registering, without any let or hindrance. Bidding shall not be restricted to any particular

class of contractors, and non-classified contractors shall also be eligible to bid.



- 14 -

Advertising; Time for Bid Preparation

5. The complete text of advertisement shall be published in a national newspaper of
wide circulation or in the official gazette provided that it is of wide circulation, or on a
widely used website or electronic portal with free national and international access. The
Borrower may publish a shorter version of the advertisement text, including the minimum
relevant information, in the national press provided that the full text is simultaneously
published in the official gazette or on a widely used website or electronic portal with free
national and international access. Notification shall be given to prospective bidders in
sufficient time to enable them to obtain relevant documents.

6. The time allowed for the preparation and submission of bids shall not be less than
thirty (30) days from the date of the invitation to bid or the date of availability of the
bidding documents, whichever is later.

Standard Bidding Documents

7. Standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank shall be used.

Qualification Criteria

8. Qualification criteria shall be clearly specified in the bidding documents, and all
criteria so specified, and only such specified criteria, shall be used to determine whether a
bidder is qualified. Qualification shall be assessed on a pass or fail basis and merit points
shall not be used. Such assessment shall only take into account the bidder's capacity and
resources to perform the contract, specifically its experience and past performance on
similar contracts, capabilities with respect to personnel, equipment, and construction and
manufacturing facilities, and financial capacity. The evaluation of the bidder's
qualifications shall be conducted separately subsequent to the technical and commercial
evaluation of the bid.

Bid Submission, Bid Opening, and Bid Evaluation

9. Bidders may submit bids, at their option, either in person or by courier service or
by mail, as required in the bidding documents. Bids shall be opened in public,
immediately after the deadline for submission of bids, regardless of the number of bids
received. Bids received after the deadline for bid submission shall be rejected and
returned to the bidders unopened. A copy of the bid opening minutes shall be promptly
provided to all bidders who submitted bids, and to the Bank with respect to contracts
subject to the Bank's prior review.

(a) Bidding documents shall be sold to anyone who is willing to pay the
required fee of the bidding documents which shall not exceed the costs of
printing, reproduction, and delivery at any time prior to the deadline for



- 15 -

bid submission, and no other conditions shall be imposed on the sale of
the bidding documents.

(b) Evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the criteria that
shall be clearly specified in the bidding documents and quantified in
monetary terms for evaluation criteria other than price; merit points shall
not be used in bid evaluation.

(c) A contract shall be awarded, within the period of the validity of bids, to
the bidder who meets the appropriate standards of capability and
resources and whose bid has been determined (i) to be substantially
responsive to the bidding documents and (ii) to offer the lowest
evaluated cost. No negotiations shall be permitted. A bidder shall neither
be required nor permitted, as a condition for award, to undertake
obligations not specified in the bidding documents or otherwise to
modify the bid as originally submitted.

(d) No bid shall be eliminated from detailed evaluation on the basis of
minor, non-substantive deviations.

(e) The comparison of all bids and the award of contract may be based on
the total cost at destination including all taxes and duties.

(f) No bid shall be rejected on the basis of a comparison with the employer's
estimate and budget ceiling without the Bank's prior written agreement.

Rejection of All Bids and Re-bidding

10. Rejection of all bids is justified when there is lack of effective competition, or all
bids are not substantially responsive, or no bidder meets the specified qualification
criteria, or the bid price of the lowest evaluated winning bid is substantially higher than
the Borrower's updated estimated cost or available budget. Lack of competition shall not
be determined solely on the basis of the number of bidders. Even when only one bid is
submitted, the bidding process may be considered valid, if the bid was satisfactorily
advertised, the qualification criteria were not unduly restrictive, and prices are reasonable
in comparison to market values. All bids shall not be rejected or new bids solicited
without the Bank's prior written agreement.

Complaints by Bidders and Handling of Complaints

11. The Borrower shall implement an effective and independent protest mechanism
allowing bidders to protest and have their protests handled in a timely manner. An
independent protest mechanism shall provide for the review of complaints by an
independent entity that is not involved in any aspect of the underlying procurement
process (e.g., bid evaluation, contract approval, etc.).



- 16 -

Fraud and Corruption

12. The provisions on fraud and corruption as stated under Section I of the
Procurement Guidelines shall apply. Each bidding document and contract financed out
of the proceeds of the Financing shall include provisions on matters pertaining to fraud
and corruption as defined in the Guidelines. The Bank will sanction a firm or individual,
at any time, in accordance with prevailing Bank sanctions procedures, including by
publicly declaring such firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated
period of time: (i) to be awarded a Bank-financed contract; and (ii) to be a nominated
sub-contractor, consultant, supplier, or service provider of an otherwise eligible firm
being awarded an Bank-financed contract.

Right to Inspect / Audit

13. Each bidding document and contract financed from the proceeds of the Financing
shall include a provision requiring bidders, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors to
permit the Bank, to inspect their accounts and records relating to the bid submission and
performance of the contract and to have said accounts and records audited by auditors
appointed by the Bank. Acts intended to materially impede the exercise of the Bank's
inspection and audit rights provided for in the Guidelines constitute an obstructive
practice as defined in the Guidelines.

License

14. Foreign contractors shall be given a reasonable opportunity to apply for and
obtain a work license, which shall not be arbitrarily withheld.

Publication of the Award of Contract

15. Within two weeks of receiving the Bank's no objection to the award
recommendation for contracts subject to the Bank's prior review, and within two weeks
of the Borrower's award decision for contracts subject to the Bank's post review, the
Borrower shall publish the following information on contract award in a national

Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
Date following the date of withdrawal.
