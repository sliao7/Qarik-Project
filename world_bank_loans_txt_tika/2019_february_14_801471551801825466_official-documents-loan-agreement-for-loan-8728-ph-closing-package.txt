Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 

payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 

time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on

billing system. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency, 
the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal 

Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by 

multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the 

Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the 

Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating 

to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan
