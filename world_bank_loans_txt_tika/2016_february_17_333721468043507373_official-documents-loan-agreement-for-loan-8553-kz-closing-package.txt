Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this

Schedule.

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

Date

following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal

Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date

following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this 
paragraph, if

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices

are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions

of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made 
after

the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this 
Schedule, upon a

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
to an

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency 
that is

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,

shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency 
of

denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange 
rate

that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable 
by the

Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; 
or (ii) if

the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, 
the

exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount 
denominated

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule
