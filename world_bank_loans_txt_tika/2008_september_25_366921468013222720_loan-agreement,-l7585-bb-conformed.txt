Part 1. Prevention and Care

(a) Supporting national program coordination and monitoring to strengthen the capacity of 
the public and private sectors and civil society partners to coordinate, monitor and evaluate their 
activities and use data to increase the quality of their programs by, inter alia, providing grants to 
support, for up to a period of 30 months per grant, subprojects carried out by civil society 
organizations to increase the establishment of self-help and support groups by and for key 
populations at higher risk and to provide for institutional strengthening especially in the areas of 
surveillance and monitoring and evaluation.  
 
(b) Supporting the scaling up of prevention efforts to increase access to preventive services, 
including behavior change communication, HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and treatment, and the 
provision of condoms, especially among key populations at higher risk. 
 
(c) Supporting the improvement of access to diagnostic services, treatment services and 
social care by people living with HIV with a view to increasing the length and quality of their 
lives. 
 
Part 2. Institutional Strengthening

Strengthening agencies and civil society organizations to support the implementation of the NSP, 
by providing training and technical assistance, that cannot be funded under the NSP, on 
monitoring and evaluation, management, surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care 
of HIV/AIDS and other STIs.

additional instructions  referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule (including compliance with 
the Milestones and DLIs, referred to in the Appendix to this Agreement, when applicable) have

2.  If the Bank has: 
 

(a) received evidence of partial compliance with the Milestone that corresponds to 
the relevant withdrawal referred to in paragraphs 1 (b) through (k) of Section IV of the additional 
instructions (referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule), then the maximum amount of the

disbursement; and 
 

(c)  reduced the withdrawal provided for in any of the paragraphs 1(b) through (j) of 
Section IV of the additional instructions (referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule), due to 
partial compliance with the Milestones or DLIs, then the Bank shall authorize the unwithdrawn 
portion of the Loan resulting from this partial compliance to be carried forward to the eleventh 
withdrawal referred to in paragraph 1(k) of Section IV of the additional instructions (referred to 
in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule), except in so far as the amount by which the withdrawal has 
been reduced was subsequently disbursed by operation of paragraph 2(b)(iii) above.

SCHEDULE 3 
 

Amortization Schedule 
 
1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 

percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

 
Principal Payment Date Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 
On each February 15 and August 15 
 

Beginning August 15, 2013  
 through February 15, 2038 

 

2% 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

 
(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 



-15- 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

 
5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
