The Loan

Section 2.01. The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms 
and conditions set forth or referred to in the Loan Agreement, an amount 
equal to three hundred million Dollars ($300,000,000).

Section 2.02. (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), 
(d) and (e) of this Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw 
the proceeds of the Loan from the Loan Account in support of the Program.

(b) The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank the 
first request for withdrawal from the Loan Account, and thereafter 
maintain in its central bank, a deposit account in Dollars on terms and 
conditions satisfactory to the Bank.  All withdrawals from the Loan 
Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit Account.

(c) The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall 
not be used to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions 
of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any 
time that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been used to make a payment 
for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice 
from the Bank: (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an amount equal to 
the amount of said payment; or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, refund 
such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request 
shall be credited to the Loan Account for cancellation.

(d) Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, withdrawals from the 
Loan Account in any month during the execution of the Program, shall be 
permitted only up to the Maximum Withdrawal Amount as defined herein. For 
purposes of this sub-paragraph, the “Maximum Withdrawal Amount” shall be 
the amount of any withdrawal from the Loan Account which would, when 
added together with the amount of proceeds withdrawn during such month 
from the Loan Accounts for any of the Associated Loans, equal the 
Cumulative Withdrawal Ceiling for such month. The “Cumulative Withdrawal 
Ceiling” for any month shall be the Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for such 
month (as defined herein), plus the cumulative amounts of any Monthly 
Withdrawal Ceiling for any previous months which remain undisbursed and 
are carried over to such month pursuant to the provisions of this 
paragraph. The Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling shall be, for the month of 
September 1998, equal to two hundred seventy million dollars 
($270,000,000); and for each month thereafter, beginning in November 
1998, shall be equal to seventy million dollars ($70,000,000). In the 
event that the aggregate amounts of loan proceeds actually disbursed from 
the Loan Accounts for the Associated Loans in any given month shall be 
less than the amount of the Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for such month, 
the difference between such actual monthly disbursements and the Monthly 



Withdrawal Ceiling shall be permitted to be carried over as an additional 
amount which shall be added to the Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for the 
next succeeding month.  Such carry-over shall continue from month to 
month as long as any portion of a Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling remains 
unwithdrawn.

(e) No withdrawals shall be made from the Loan Account: 

(A) after the aggregate of the proceeds of the Loan 
withdrawn from the Loan Account shall have reached 
the equivalent of one hundred million Dollars 
($100,000,000), unless the Bank shall be satisfied, after an exchange of 
views as described in Section 3.01 of this Agreement based 
on evidence satisfactory to the Bank: (i) that the 
macro-economic framework of the Borrower is 
consistent with the Program as determined on the basis of indicators 
agreed upon by the Borrower and the Bank; (ii) with 
the progress achieved by the Borrower in the 
carrying out of the Program; and (iii) that the actions 

described in Section I of Schedule 2 to this Agreement have been 
taken; and

(B) after the aggregate of the proceeds of the Loan 
withdrawn from the Loan Account shall have reached 
the equivalent of two hundred million Dollars 
($200,000,000), unless the Bank shall be satisfied, after an exchange of 
views as described in Section 3.01 of this Agreement based 
on evidence satisfactory to the Bank: (i) that the 
macro-economic framework of the Borrower is 
consistent with the Program as determined on the basis of indicators 
agreed upon by the Borrower and the Bank; (ii) with 
the progress achieved by the Borrower in the 
carrying out of the Program; and (iii) that the actions 

described in Section II of Schedule 2 to this Agreement have been 
taken.

(f) If, after said exchange of views, the Bank shall have given 
notice to the Borrower that the progress achieved and actions taken are 
not satisfactory and, within 90 days after such notice, the Borrower 
shall not have achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the 
Bank, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan or any part thereof.

Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be December 31, 1999, or such 
later date as the Bank shall establish.  The Bank shall promptly notify 
the Borrower of such later date.

Section 2.04. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment 
charge at the rate of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per annum 
on the principal amount of the Loan not withdrawn from time to time.

Section 2.05. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal 
amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a rate 
for each Interest Period equal to LIBOR Base Rate plus LIBOR Total 
Spread.

(b) For the purposes of this Section:

(i) “Interest Period” means the initial period from and 
including the date of this Agreement to, but 
excluding, the first Interest Payment Date occurring 
thereafter, and after the initial period, each period from and including 
an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding the next 
following Interest Payment Date.

(ii) “Interest Payment Date” means any date specified in 



Section 2.06 of this Agreement.

(iii) “LIBOR Base Rate” means, for each Interest Period, 
the London interbank offered rate for six-month 
deposits in Dollars for value the first day of such 
Interest Period (or, in the case of the initial Interest Period, for 
value the Interest Payment Date occurring on or next 
preceding the first day of such Interest Period), as 
reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a 
percentage per annum.

(iv) “LIBOR Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: 
(A) one half of one percent (1/2 of 1%); (B) 
minus (or plus) the weighted average margin, for such 
Interest Period, below (or above) the London interbank offered rates, or 
other reference rates, for six-month deposits, in respect 
of the Bank’s outstanding borrowings or portions thereof 
allocated by the Bank to fund single currency loans or 
portions thereof made by it that include the Loan; as reasonably 

determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage per 
annum.

(c) The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate and 
LIBOR Total Spread for each Interest Period, promptly upon the 
determination thereof.

(d) Whenever, in light of changes in market practice affecting 
the determination of the interest rates referred to in this Section 2.05, 
the Bank determines that it is in the interest of its borrowers as a 
whole and of the Bank to apply a basis for determining the interest rates 
applicable to the Loan other than as provided in said Section, the Bank 
may modify the basis for determining the interest rates applicable to the 
Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower of the new 
basis. The basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice 
period unless the Borrower notifies the Bank during said period of its 
objection thereto, in which case said modification shall not apply to the 
Loan.

Section 2.06. Interest and other charges shall be payable 
semiannually on January 15 and July 15 in each year.

Section 2.07. The Borrower shall repay the principal amount of the 
Loan in accordance with the amortization schedule set forth in Schedule 3 
to this Agreement.
