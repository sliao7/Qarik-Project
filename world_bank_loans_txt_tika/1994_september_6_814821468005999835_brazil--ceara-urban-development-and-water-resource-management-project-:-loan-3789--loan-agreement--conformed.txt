SCHEDULE 4 

Procurement and Consultants’ Services 

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works 

  

Part A: | International Competitive Bidding 

1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be 
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures 

consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the 

"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 

published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines). 

(a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid 

referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, 
when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity 
period, the successful bidder’s bid price will be increased for each 
week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to 
the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign currency components and 
the other to the local currency component of the bid price. Such an 
increase shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. 

(b) In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with 
this Part A, the Borrower shall use or cause to be used the relevant 

standard bidding documents issued by the Bank for the use of its 
borrowers, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have 

agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Project. Where no 

relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, 
the Borrower shall use or cause to be used bidding documents based 
on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the 
Bank. 

Part B;: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures 
described in Part A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be 
granted a margin of preference in accordance with the provisions of 
the Guidelines, provided, however, that: 

l. All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall 
clearly indicate any preference which would be granted, the 
information required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such 
preference and the following methods and stages that will be 
followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids. 

  
 



  

  

- 25 - 

2. After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of 
the following two groups: 

(a) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if 

the bidder shall have established to the satisfaction of 
the Borrower and the Bank that such goods contain 
components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 502% 
of the value of the complete goods. 

(b) Group B: bids offering any other goods. 

3. In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, 
all evaluated bids in each group shall first be compared among 
themselves, without taking into account customs duties and other 
import taxes levied in connection with the importation, or the sales 
and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of 
the goods pursuant to the bids. Such lowest evaluated bids shall 
then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this 
comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected 
for the award. 

4. If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the 
lowest evaluated bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall 
be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group A after 
adding: 

(a) to the evaluated bid price of goods to be imported in 

each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the amount 
of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer 
would have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such 
group B bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods; and 

(b) to the evaluated bid price of goods supplied 
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the 
smaller of: (i) the amount of customs duties and other import taxes 
which would be levied on the goods offered in such group B if they 
originated from the same foreign country as the bid included in 
group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import 
taxes; or (ii) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. 

If, as a result of this comparison, the bid from group A is the 
lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the lowest 

evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, 

shall be selected for the award.

Part C:; Other Procurement Procedures 

l. Civil works and goods estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$5,000,000 and $250,000 or less per contract, respectively, up to an 

aggregate amount equivalent to $98,600,000, in the case of civil 
works, and $26,000,000, in the case of goods, may be procured under 

contracts awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised 
locally, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. 

2. Civil works and goods estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$100,000 and $25,000 or less per contract, respectively, up to an 

aggregate amount equivalent to $7,000,000, in the case of civil 
works, and $20,500,000, in the case of goods, may be procured under 
contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price quotations 
obtained from at least three contractors or suppliers, as the case 
may be, eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance with procedures 
acceptable to the Bank. 

  

Part Ds: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions 

l. Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final 
contracts: 

(a) With respect to each contract to be awarded pursuant to 

the provisions of Part A hereof, and to all contracts for civil 
works estimated to cost the equivalent of $2,000,000 or more, to be 

awarded pursuant to the provisions of Part C.1 hereof, the 
procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the 
Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be 
made out of the Special Account, such procedures shall be modified 
to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract required to 
be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be 
furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment out 
of the Special Account in respect of such contract. 

(b) With respect to each contract not governed by the 

preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 
of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such 
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, said procedures 
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the 
contract together with the other information required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be 
furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall 

not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals are to be 
made on the basis of statements of expenditure. 

2. The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of 
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines. 

Part. E: FSRMM

Decree Law 1,142 of December 30, 1970, as amended to December 31, 

1987, or any other tax, levy or charge that, in the reasonable 
opinion of the Bank, may substitute it, in whole or in part, after 
January 1, 1988. 

Part F: Special Provisions 

Without limitation to any other provisions set forth in this 
Schedule or the Guidelines, the following shall apply to the 
procurement of goods and/or works to be undertaken pursuant to Part 
C hereof: 

l. Contracts shall be awarded to the bidder whose bid has been 
determined to be the lowest evaluated bid, such evaluation to be 

based on price and, whenever appropriate, to also take into account 
factors similar to those referred to in paragraph 2.51 of the 
Guidelines, provided, however, that the bid evaluation shall always 

be based on factors that can be quantified objectively, and the 

procedure for such quantification shall be disclosed in the 
invitation to bid. 

2. Whenever required by the Bank, the invitation to bid shall be 
advertised for at least three consecutive days in a newspaper of 
wide circulation in Brazil. 

3. The arrangements, under the invitation to bid, for a joint- 

venture (consércio) of Brazilian and foreign firms shall be approved 

in advance by the Bank in each case. 

4. The invitation to bid shall not establish, for purposes of

5. The purchaser shall not, without the Bank’s prior approval, 
issue any change order under a contract which would increase or 
decrease by more than 15% the quantity of goods (and related 
services) without any change in the unit prices or other terms and 
conditions of sale. 

Section IIL. Employment of Consultants 

l. In order to assist the Borrower and the Beneficiaries in the 
carrying out of the Project, the Borrower shall employ or cause to 
be employed consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms 
and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Such 
consultants shall be selected in accordance with principles and 
procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines 
for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World 
Bank as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981 (the 
Consultant Guidelines). For complex, time-based assignments, the 
Borrower shall employ or cause to be employed such consultants under 
contracts using the standard form of contract for consultants’ 
services issued by the Bank for the use of its borrowers, with such 
modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where no 
relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank, 
the Borrower shall use or cause to be used other standard forms 
agreed with the Bank. 

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, 
the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank 
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, 
letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts 
shall not apply to: (a) contracts for the employment of consulting 
firms estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each or (b)

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 
Account.
