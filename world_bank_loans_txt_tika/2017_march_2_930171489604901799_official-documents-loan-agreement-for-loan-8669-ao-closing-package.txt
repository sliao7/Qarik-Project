Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this

Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall 
be

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount

of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the

original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any

Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date

following the date of withdrawal.

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices

are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions

of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after

the adoption of such billing system.

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,

shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of

denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate

that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the

Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if

the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the

exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule 
for each

such amount.
