SCHEDULE 2 

Project Execution 

Section I. Implementation Arrangements 

A. Institutional Arrangements 

The Borrower shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, the following implementation 
arrangements throughout the implementation of the Project. 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

Board of Directors. 

The Borrower has established and shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, the Board of 

Directors with terms of reference, composition and resources satisfactory to capably, inter 

alia, provide overall direction and strategic guidance to NAPPP and carry out monitoring 
and evaluation of the Project (in addition to the monitoring of the Proposed PPP 

Transactions supported by NAPPP). 

NAPPP. 

The Borrower has established and shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, NAPPP with 

terms of reference, composition and resources satisfactory to the Bank to, inter alia, 

provide support to other government’s agencies for the identification, preparation, 

evaluation, negotiations and award of their Proposed PPP Transactions supported under 

the Project. 

The Borrower is in the process of restructuring NAPPP, which restructuring is expected to 

include its incorporation as a legal entity distinct from the Borrower and the conversion of 

the Board of Directors into the new legal entity’s board of directors. The Bank confirms 
that the incorporation of NAPPP is acceptable in principle, taking into consideration the 

Bank’s views on any potential adverse impact of the specific terms and conditions of such 

incorporation on the implementation of the Project and the achievement of its development 

objective. 

Without limitation to the generality of the provisions in paragraph 2(a) immediately above: 

(i) in addition to strengthening NAPPP’s work force (through staff and consultants) 

as part of the Project, the Borrower shall assign staff from the Borrower’s Ministry 

of Finance and Mass Media and/or recruit, or cause to be recruited, staff and 

consultants as needed, in adequate number and each with terms of reference, 

qualifications and experience also acceptable to the Bank to, inter alia, provide



overall coordination of the activities in the Project, including a team of dedicated 

staff responsible for procurement and management of the consultant services, 

financial management, monitoring and evaluation, reporting, and compliance with 
environmental and social safeguards requirement; 

(ii) without limitation to the generality of the foregoing provisions in paragraph (c)(i) 

immediately above, among the staff listed in paragraph (c)(i) immediately above, 

the Borrower shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, a small team of focal points 

who will act as interface to the Bank for the Project supervision and monitoring by 
the Bank (thereafter collectively referred to as the “Project Team”). The Project 

Team shall include: a Procurement Specialist, a Financial Management Specialist, 
an Environmental Specialist and a Social Specialist. 

(iii) — without limitation to the generality of the foregoing provisions in paragraph (c)(ii) 

immediately above, it is acknowledged that the Borrower has already assigned 

staff or recruited consultants for procurement and management of the consultant 
services, as well as financial management, as members of the Project Team. The 

Borrower shall, no later than one (1) month after the Effective Date, assign staff or 
recruit consultants for monitoring and evaluation, reporting, and compliance with 

environmental and social safeguards requirement. 

Arrangements Specific to the Implementation of Proposed PPP Transactions Not Part of 
the Project Implementation Arrangement. 

For the avoidance of doubt, any implementation arrangements which may be established 

by the Borrower (through its relevant line ministry or otherwise) for the purpose of 

monitoring the implementation (as opposed to monitoring the preparation) of Proposed 

PPP Transactions, whose preparation has been supported under Part B of the Project, are 

not part of the implementation arrangement for the Project.

technical assistance or studies carried out under the Project are consistent with, and pay 

due attention to, the Bank Policies, as well as the Borrower’s own laws relating to the 

environment and social aspects relevant to the Project. 

Prior to the inclusion of a Proposed PPP Transaction for preparation under Part B of the 

Project, the Borrower shall carry out the screening process described in the Safeguard

guidelines, procedures, timetables and other specifications set forth in the Safeguard 
Documents. In particular, the Borrower shall ensure that: 

(a) for each activity under the Project of a type for which the Environmental

pursuant to this Agreement, to ensure compliance with Bank Policies with respect to the 

physical implementation of any Proposed PPP Transaction. 

Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree in writing and subject to compliance with 

applicable consultation and public disclosure requirements of the Bank, the Borrower shall 

not abrogate, amend, repeal, suspend or waive any provisions of any of the Safeguard 

Documents, nor permit any entity participating in the implementation of the Project to do

basis and promptly in a separate report whenever the circumstances warrant, reports on the 

status of compliance with the Safeguard Documents, giving details of: (a) measures taken
