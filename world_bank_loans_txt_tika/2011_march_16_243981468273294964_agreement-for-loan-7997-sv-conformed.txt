LOAN AGREEMENT 
 

Agreement dated March 16, 2011, entered into between the REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR 
(“Borrower”) and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND 
DEVELOPMENT (“Bank”) for the purpose of providing financing in support of the Program (as 
defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).  The Bank has decided to provide this financing on 
the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions which the Borrower has already taken under the Program 
and which are described in Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower’s 
maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework.  The Borrower and the Bank 
therefore hereby agree as follows: 

 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 
 
1.01. The General Conditions (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement) constitute an 

integral part of this Agreement. 
 
1.02. Unless the context requires otherwise, the capitalized terms used in this Agreement have 

the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in the Appendix to this 
Agreement. 

 
ARTICLE II — LOAN 

 
2.01. The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or referred 

to in this Agreement, the amount of fifty million Dollars ($50,000,000), as such amount 
may be converted from time to time through a Currency Conversion in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 2.07 of this Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02. The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program in 

accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. 

2.03. The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one half of one percent 
(0.50%) of the Loan amount.   

 
2.04. If, at the Borrower’s request and on such terms and conditions as the Bank may agree, the 

Closing Date is extended, the fee payable by the Borrower for each extension of the 
Closing Date shall be at the rate of one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the amount of 
the Loan available for withdrawal upon such extension.  If the Borrower elects to 
capitalize the fee from the Loan, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and pay to itself such amounts required to pay such fee.  If the 
Borrower elects to pay the fee from its own resources, the Borrower shall pay such fee 
not later than sixty days after the date of the notice given by the Bank to the Borrower 
confirming the extension of the Closing Date. 

 
2.05.  The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate equal to 

the Reference Rate for the Loan Currency plus the Fixed Spread; provided that, upon a 
Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the interest payable 



-2- 

 

by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on such amount shall be determined in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains 
unpaid when due and such non-payment continues for a period of thirty days, then the 
interest payable by the Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 
(e) of the General Conditions. 

 
2.06. The Payment Dates are February 15 and August15 in each year. 
 
2.07. (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this Section, the principal 

amount of the Loan shall be repaid in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 
2 to this Agreement. 

 
(b) The Borrower may at the time of requesting a Withdrawal also request repayment 

provisions different from those set out in Schedule 2 to this Agreement for such 
Withdrawal, provided that: (i) the average maturity of such Withdrawal does not 
exceed 18 years from the Withdrawal Date and the final maturity of such 
Withdrawal does not exceed 30 years from the Withdrawal Date (or such other 
average maturity and/or final maturity as may be generally applicable to loans 
made by the Bank to the Borrower at the time of such agreement); and (ii) such 
repayment provisions have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank prior 
to the Withdrawal Date of such Withdrawal. 

 
2.08. (a) The Borrower may at any time request any of the following Conversions of the 

terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: (i) a change of 
the Loan Currency of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, 
withdrawn or unwithdrawn, to an Approved Currency; (ii) a change of the 
interest rate basis applicable to all or any portion of the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice 
versa, or from a Variable Rate based on a Variable Spread to a Variable Rate 
based on a Fixed Spread; and (iii) the setting of limits on the Variable Rate 
applicable to all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn 
and outstanding by the establishment of an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate 
Collar on the Variable Rate. 

 
(b) Any conversion requested pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section that is 

accepted by the Bank shall be considered a “Conversion”, as defined in the 
General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the provisions of 
Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion Guidelines.  

 
2.09. Without limitation upon the provisions of paragraph (a) of Section 2.07 of this 

Agreement and unless otherwise notified by the Borrower to the Bank in accordance with 
the provisions of the Conversion Guidelines, the interest rate basis applicable to 
consecutive withdrawals from the Loan Account which in the aggregate equal or exceed 
five million Dollars ($5,000,000) shall be converted from the initial Variable Rate to a 
Fixed Rate for the full maturity of such amount in accordance with the provisions of the 
General Conditions and of the Conversion Guidelines. 

 



-3- 

 

2.10. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower may, by notice to the Bank, refund 
any amount of the Withdrawn Balance for the purpose of re-crediting such amount to the 
Loan Account for further withdrawals.  Upon such refund, the repayment schedule shall 
be adjusted on a pro rata basis, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. 

 
2.11. Without limitation upon the provisions of Section 5.08 of the General Conditions 

(renumbered as such pursuant to paragraph 3 of Section II of the Appendix to this 
Agreement and relating to Cooperation and Consultation), the Borrower shall promptly 
furnish to the Bank such information relating to the provisions of this Article II as the 
Bank may, from time to time, reasonably request.
