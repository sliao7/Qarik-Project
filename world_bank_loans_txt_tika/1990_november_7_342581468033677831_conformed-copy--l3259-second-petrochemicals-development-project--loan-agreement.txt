materials estimated to cost the equivalent of $750,000 or more and
all contracts for engineering services financed out of the proceeds
of the Loan, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of
Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, such procedures
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the
contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said
paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making
of the first payment out of the Special Account in respect of such
contract.

(b) With respect to each contract not governed by the prece-
ding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of
Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, such procedures
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the
contract together with the other information required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be furn-
ished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished pursuant
to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.
 

(c) The provisions of the preceding sub-paragraph (b) shall
not apply to contracts on account of which the Bank has authorized
withdrawals from the Loan Account on the basis of statements of
expenditure. Such contracts shall be retained in accordance with
Section 5.01 (c) (ii) of this Agreement.
 
2. The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of
paragraph 4 of Appendix l to the Guidelines.
 

SCHEDULE 5



Special Account

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:
 

(a) The term "eligible Categories" means Categories (l),
(2), and (3) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement;

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for
Parts A and B of the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds
of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories
in accordance with the provisions of Schedule l to this Agreement;
and

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equiva-
lent to $20,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of
this Schedule.

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Auth-
orized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
 

(A) for withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.
 

(b)   (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
deposits into the Special Account at such inter-
vals as the Bank shall specify.

 
(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other
evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for
the payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is
requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall,
on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and
deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said
documents and other evidence to have been made out of the
Special Account for eligible expenditures.

 
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the res-
pective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
 
4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall rea-
sonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Sched-
ule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into



the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories for Parts A and B of the Project, less
the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to Parts A and B of the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice
the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
for Parts A and B of the Project shall follow such procedures as the
Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank
shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
 
6.    (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
