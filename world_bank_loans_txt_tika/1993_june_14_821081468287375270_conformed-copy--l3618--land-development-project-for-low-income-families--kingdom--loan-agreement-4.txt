                  Sub-loans: Criteria, Procedures

      Except as the Bank and the Borrower may otherwise agree, the
criteria, procedures and principal terms and conditions set forth in
this Schedule shall apply for the purposes of Section 3.02 (a) of
this Agreement.

economically viable; (ii) in respect of which all required approvals
of the concerned governmental authorities have been secured; and

satisfaction of the Borrower on the basis of an appraisal carried
out in accordance with the Credit Policy Guidelines and additional
guidelines satisfactory to the Bank.

2.    No expenditures for goods or services required for an
Investment Project shall be eligible for financing out of the
proceeds of the Loan unless:

earlier than 180 days prior to the date on which the Bank shall have
received the request and information required under paragraph 3 (b)
of this Schedule in respect of such free-limit Sub-loan. For the

financed or proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
or of any other loan, provided for in any outstanding loan agreement

before the date of this Agreement, the proceeds of which have been
or are being used for financing goods and services directly and
materially related to such Investment Project, the foregoing amount
being subject to change from time to time as determined by the Bank.

3.    (a)   When presenting a Sub-loan (other than a free-limit
Sub-loan) to the Bank for approval, the Borrower shall furnish to

Investment Project, including a description of the expenditures
proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan; (ii) the
proposed terms and conditions of the Sub-loan, including the
schedule of amortization of the Sub-loan; and (iii) such other
information as the Bank shall reasonably request.

      (b)   Each request by the Borrower for authorization to make
withdrawals from the Loan Account in respect of a free-limit
Sub-loan shall contain: (i) a summary description of the Beneficiary
and the Investment Project, including a description of the
expenditures proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan, and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Sub-loan, including
the schedule of amortization therefor.

      (c)   Applications and requests made pursuant to the

amount thereof withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a
rate determined by the Borrower in accordance with the Credit Policy
Guidelines; and (b) made for a period determined pursuant to the
Credit Policy Guidelines and not exceeding (i) in respect of a Sub-
loan made for an Investment Project for the development of sites or

inclusive of a grace period of 4 years and (ii) in respect of any
other Sub-loan, 20 years, inclusive of a grace period of 4 years.

5.    Each Sub-loan shall be made on further terms whereby the
Borrower shall obtain, by written contract with the Beneficiary or
by other appropriate legal means, rights adequate to protect the
interests of the Bank and the Borrower, including:

      (a)   that each Beneficiary shall undertake to: (i) carry out
and operate the Investment Project with due diligence and efficiency
and in accordance with sound technical, financial and managerial
standards and appropriate safety, health and environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank, maintain adequate records and provide,
promptly as needed, the funds, facilities and other resources
required for the purpose; (ii) procure the goods and services to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan at a reasonable price,
account being taken also of other relevant factors such as time of
delivery and efficiency and reliability of the goods and
availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts therefor,
and, in the case of services, of their quality and the competence of
the parties rendering them, and utilize such goods and services
exclusively in the carrying out of the Investment Project; (iii)
enable the Bank and the Borrower to inspect such goods and the



sites, works, plants and construction included in the Investment
Project, the operation thereof, and any relevant records and
documents; (iv) take out and maintain with responsible insurers such
insurance, against such risks and in such amounts, as shall be
consistent with sound business practice, including, without
limitation, such insurance to cover hazards incident to the
acquisition, transportation and delivery of goods financed out of
the proceeds of the Loan to the place of use or installation, any
indemnity thereunder to be made payable in a currency freely usable
by the Beneficiary to replace or repair such goods; and (v) prepare
and furnish to the Borrower for forwarding to the Bank, if so
requested by the Bank, all such information as the Bank or the
Borrower shall reasonably request relating to the foregoing and to
the administration, operations and financial condition of the
Beneficiary and to the benefits to be derived from the Investment
Project; and

      (b)   provisions to ensure the right of the Borrower to
suspend or terminate the right of the Beneficiary to the use of the
proceeds of the Loan upon failure by such Beneficiary to perform its
obligations under its contract providing for the Sub-loan.
