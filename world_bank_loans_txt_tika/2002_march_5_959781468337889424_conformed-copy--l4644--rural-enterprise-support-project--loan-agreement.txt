1. For the purposes of this Annex the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount 
equivalent to $1,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special 
Account pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Annex; provided, however, that unless the Bank shall

Conditions shall equal or exceed the equivalent of $2,500,000.

2. Withdrawals of the Special Account’s Authorized Allocation and subsequent

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which

equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal 
from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such 
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall
