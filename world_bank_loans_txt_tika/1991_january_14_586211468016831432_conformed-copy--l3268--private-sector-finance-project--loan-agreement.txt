SCHEDULE 6



Procurement and Consultants Services

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works
 
Part A: International Competitive Bidding
 
1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be procured under 
contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in 
Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 
published by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines).

2. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent 
of $5,000,000 or more and contracts for works estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$10,000,000 or more shall be grouped in bidding packages so as to permit international 
competitive bidding.

Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 
A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in 
accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the 
Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto, provided, however, that:

1. All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly indicate any 
preference which would be granted, the information required to establish the 
eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the following methods and stages that will be followed in the 
evaluation and comparison of bids.

2. After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the following two 
groups:

(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the bidder shall 
have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that such 
goods contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of 
the value of the complete goods.

(2) Group B: bids offering any other goods.
 
3. In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, all evaluated bids 
in each group shall first be compared among themselves, without taking into account 
customs duties and
other import taxes levied in connection with the importation, or the sales and similar 
taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of the goods pursuant to the 
bids. Such lowest evaluated
bids shall then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a 
bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award.

4. If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the lowest evaluated 
bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared with the lowest 
evaluated bid from group A after adding: (i) to the evaluated bid price of goods to be 
imported in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the amount of 
customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay 
for the importation of the goods offered in such group B bid; or (B) 15% of the c.i.f. 
bid price of such goods; and (ii) to the ex-factory bid price of goods supplied 
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the 
amount of customs duties and other import taxes which would be levied on the goods 
offered in such group B if they originated from the same foreign country as the bid 
included in group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import taxes, or 
(B) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. If, as a result of this comparison, 
the bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the 
lowest evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, shall be 
selected for the award.

Part C: Other Procurement Procedures
 



1. Works estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $10,000,000 may be procured 
under contracts awarded in accordance with established commercial practices acceptable 
to the Bank.

2. Goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $5,000,000 but more than the 
equivalent of $3,000,000 may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of 
comparison of price quotations solicited from at least three suppliers, of which at 
least two shall be foreign suppliers, eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance 
with procedures acceptable to the Bank.

3. Goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $3,000,000 or less may be procured 
under contracts awarded in accordance with established commercial practices acceptable 
to the Bank.

Part D: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
 
1. Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts:
 

(a) The procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the 
Guidelines shall apply to all contracts. Where payments for such contracts are to be 
made out of the Special Accounts, such procedures shall be modified to ensure that the 
two conformed copies of the contract together with the other information required to 
be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3shall be furnished to the Bank as 
part of the evidence to be furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 7 to this 
Agreement.

(b) The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (a) shall not apply to 
contracts on account of which the Bank has authorized withdrawals from the Loan 
Account on the basis of statements of expenditure.

2. The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 
to the Guidelines.

Part E: Other
 

For purposes of this Schedule and the Guidelines, the term "customs duties and 
other import taxes" includes the FSRMM.

Section II. Employment of Consultants
 

In order to assist the Borrower in carrying out Part B of the Project, the 
Borrower shall employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and 
conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be 
selected in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the 
basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the

SCHEDULE 7

Special Accounts: CESA and FESA

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:
 

(a) the term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1) and (2) set forth in 
the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

(b) the term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods, works and services required for Investment Projects and for 
Part B of the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated 
from time to time to the Eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement, provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions 
of paragraph 2 (b) of Schedule 5 to this Agreement, payments for expenditures to be 
financed out of the proceeds of Free-limit Sub-loans may be made out of the Special 
Account before the Bank shall have authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account in 
respect thereof. Such expenditures, however, shall qualify as Eligible Expenditures 
only if the Bank shall subsequently authorize such withdrawals; and



(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to 
$40,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into CESA and FESA 
($35,000,000 equivalent into CESA and $5,000,000 equivalent into FESA) pursuant to 
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.

2. Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of CESA and FESA, as the 
case may be, shall be made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 2.02 of this Agreement and of this Schedule. The Central 
Bank, or the Account Bank, as the case may be, shall authorize withdrawals from CESA 
or FESA, as the case may be, on the basis of evidence that the Bank shall have 
reasonably determined. For each such withdrawal so authorized, the Central Bank, or 
the Account Bank, as the case may be, shall debit or cause to be debited, CESA or 
FESA, as appropriate, with the dollar equivalent of the amount of the Eligible 
Expenditures in question in Cruzeiros, in the case of CESA, or the actual dollar 
amount, or the dollar equivalent of the Eligible Expenditures in currencies other than 
dollars or Cruzeiros, in the case of FESA.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that CESA and FESA have 
been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals 
to replenish CESA or FESA shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the 
aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on 
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into CESA or FESA, 
as the case may be, such
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of CESA or FESA, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank requests for deposits into CESA or FESA at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify.
 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,  withdraw from the Loan 
Account and deposit into CESA or FESA, as the case may be, such 
amount as the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been 
shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of 
CESA or FESA, as the case may be, for Eligible Expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the 
respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of CESA or FESA, as the case may be, 
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the 
Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively 
for Eligible Expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into CESA or FESA:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the Eligible 
Categories less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, 
shall be equal to the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 



the Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in CESA or FESA, as the case may be, as of the date of such 
notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
either CESA or FESA: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional 
evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into CESA or FESA as the case may be 
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into CESA or FESA shall be made 
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the 
case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in either CESA or FESA will not be required to cover further payments for Eligible 
Expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in CESA or FESA.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
