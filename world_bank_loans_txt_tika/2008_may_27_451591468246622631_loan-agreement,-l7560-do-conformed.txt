The objectives of the Project are: (i) to increase the CRI of the three EDEs, through the 
rehabilitation of distribution networks in selected areas; and (ii) to improve the quality of 
electricity service in the Borrower’s territory. 
 

The Project consists of the following parts:

EDENORTE, EDESUR and EDEESTE networks, through, inter alia:

(a) the replacement of existing rundown and aged medium and low voltage overhead 
lines;  

 
(b)  the expansion of distribution substations and feeders;

in exchange for regularization of illegal connections and prompt payment of bills. Each affected 
community shall benefit, inter alia, from the following actions: 
 

(a) the diagnosis of the socioeconomic characteristics of each community, as well as 
the diagnosis of the current status of the electrical service and formulation of

organizations, and local authorities in support of the 24 Hours of Light Program; 
 

(c) the carrying out of the necessary information, dissemination and community 
educational activities for the implementation of the 24 Hours of Light Program; 

 
(d) the carrying out of monitoring and evaluation of the 24 Hours of Light Program;

(e) the provision of training, preparation of accountability reports, as well as the 
preparation of community forums for the maintenance of the social network. 

 
Part 3: Technical Assistance and Project Management

(a) Provision of technical assistance and training to CDEEE for the debt 
restructuring of the EDEs, through: (i) the carrying out of legal and financial 
assessment on the amounts and legal status of the debts remaining after 
compensations have been paid; and (ii) the identification of a viable option for 
debt restructuring, followed by the preparation of a plan for its execution. 

 
(b) Carrying out of periodic consumer satisfaction surveys in order to measure the 

level of satisfaction of consumers with respect to the quality of electricity 
services in the rehabilitated circuits. 

 
(c) (i) Provision of technical assistance (including audits) and the financing of 

operational costs to UERS for Project coordination, implementation and 
supervision; and (ii) the design and implementation of a monitoring and 
evaluation system for the Project.

as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts

Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts

applies. 

 
3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal

withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if at any 

time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
