Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this

equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to



- 21 -

the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date

of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)

provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the

Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such

evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower

shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for

subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
