Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully

Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be 

determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the

Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency

Schedule. 

 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

Conversion applies.

following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal 

Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date
