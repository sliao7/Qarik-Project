2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan 
Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph | of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid 
on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such 

withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment 
Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal 
Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is 

the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment 
Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as 
necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 

withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at 
any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of 

such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the 
adoption of such billing system. 

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate 
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank 

-15- 

 



under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank 
so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate 
component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 

Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such 
amount.
