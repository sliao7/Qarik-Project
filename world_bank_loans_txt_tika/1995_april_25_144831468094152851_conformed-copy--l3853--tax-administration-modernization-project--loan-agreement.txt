second time only if the bidding documents or the request for
extension shall provide for appropriate adjustment of the bid
price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract
over the period of extension. Such an increase in the bid price
shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. With
respect to each contract made subject to the Bank’s prior
review in accordance with the provisions of Part D.1(a) of this
Section, the Bank’s prior approval will be required for: (i) a
first extension of the bid validity period if the period of
extension exceeds sixty (60) days; and (ii) any subsequent
extension of the bid validity period.

    (b)   In the procurement of goods in accordance with this
Part A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding
documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto
as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes

procedures described in Part A hereof, goods manufactured in
the Russian Federation may be granted a margin of preference in

2.  Items or groups of items estimated to cost the equivalent of
$300,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount

on the basis of comparison of price quotations obtained from at
least three suppliers from at least three different countries
eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank.

3.  Items or groups of items for goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of $50,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate

competitive bidding procedures referred to in Part C.1 hereof,
the first two contracts awarded under international shopping

contracts awarded under local shopping procedures referred to
in Part C.3 hereof, and each contract awarded under direct
shopping procedures referred to in Part C.4 hereof, the
procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the
Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to
be made out of the Special Account, such procedures shall be
modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the
contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said
paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the
making of the first payment out of the Special Account in
respect of such contract.

    (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the
preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3
and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where
payments for such contract are to be made out of the Special
Account, said procedures shall be modified to ensure that the
two conformed copies of the contract together with the other

said paragraph 3 shall be furnished to the Bank as part of the
evidence to be furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 6
to this Agreement.

Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining

from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required
to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
