SCHEDULE 4 

Procurement and Consultants’ Services 

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works 

Part A: International Competitive Bidding 

1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be 
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures 
consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the 
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines). 

(a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid 

referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, 
when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity 
period, the successful bidder's bid price will be increased for each 
week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to 
the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign currency components and 
the other to the local currency component of the bid price. Such an 
increase shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. 

(b) In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with 
this Part A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding 
documents issued by the Bank for the use of its borrowers, with such 
modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary 
for the purposes of the Project. Where no relevant standard bidding 
documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use 
bidding documents based on other internationally recognized standard 
forms agreed with the Bank. 

2. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods and works shall 
be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$300,000 or more for goods and of more than $5,000,000 for works. 

3. For purposes of this Schedule, the term "works" includes Other 
Services. 

Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers 
  

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures 
described in Part A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be 
granted a margin of preference in accordance with the provisions of 
the Guidelines, provided, however, that: 

  

 



  

  

  

- 25 - 

1. All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall 
clearly indicate any preference which would be granted, the 
information required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such 
preference and the following methods and stages that will be 
followed in the comparison of bids. 

2. After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of 

the following two groups: 

(a) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if 

the bidder shall have established to the satisfaction of the 
Borrower and the Bank that such goods contain components 
manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the 

complete goods. 

(b) Group B: bids offering any other goods. 

3. In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, 
all evaluated bids in each group shall first be compared among 
themselves, without taking into account customs duties and other 
import taxes levied in connection with the importation, or the sales 
and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of 

the goods pursuant to the bids. Such lowest evaluated bids shall 
then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this 
comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected 

for the award. 

4. If, as result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the 
lowest evaluated bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall 
be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from Group A after 

adding: 

(a) to the evaluated bid price of goods to be imported in 

each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the amount 
of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer 
would have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such 
group B bids; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods; and 

(b) to the evaluated bid price of goods supplied 
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the 
smaller of: (i) the amount of customs duties and other import taxes 

which would be levied on the goods offered in such group B if they 
originated from the same foreign country as the bid included in 
group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import 

taxes; or (ii) 15% of the evaluated bid price of such goods. 

  

  
  
 



  

  
  

If, as result of this comparison, the bid from group A is the 
lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the lowest 

evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, 
shall be selected for the award. 

Part C: Other Procurement Procedures 

l. The following items may be procured under contracts awarded on 
the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in accordance 
with procedures satisfactory to the Bank: 

(a) works estimated to cost the equivalent of less than
