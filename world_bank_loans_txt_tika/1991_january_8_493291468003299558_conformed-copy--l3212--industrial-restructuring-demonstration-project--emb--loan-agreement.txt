withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to
the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do  not exceed the

Eligible Expenditures.
 
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance with the

Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions  with respect to the Project,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn  amount of
the Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only
