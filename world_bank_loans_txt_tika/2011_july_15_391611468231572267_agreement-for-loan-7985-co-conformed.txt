Additional Provisions Relating to  

Particular Methods of Procurement 

 

Section I. National Competitive Bidding 

 

Goods estimated to cost less than $300,000 equivalent per contract and works 

estimated to cost less than $5,000,000 equivalent per contract, may be procured under 

contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding, subject to the following 

additional provisions: 

 

(a) Before issuing any invitation to bid, the Borrower shall use, or cause to 

be used, standard bidding documents, as approved by the Bank for 

bidding under the Project and incorporated in the Operational Manual 

(the “Standard Bidding Documents”). Any change or departure from the 

Standard Bidding Document approved by the Bank shall require its prior 

approval. 

 

(b) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or citizens of the 

Borrower’s territory, will be treated equally and, particularly, no 

preference will be granted to any bidder or group of bidders for bid 

evaluation purposes. Bidders shall be allowed to submit their bids by 

hand or through the post office or private mailing services. There shall 

not be any requirement for any bidder to show evidence of the bidder's 

registration in any public registry, chamber of commerce or similar 

entity, whether in the Borrower’s territory or elsewhere, or to appoint a 

representative domiciled in Borrower’s territory, unless and until such 

bidder is awarded the corresponding contract. 

 

(c) Bids shall be opened in a public meeting to which bidders and their 

representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and 

place for the opening meeting shall be set forth in the bidding 

documents. Bid opening shall coincide with, or take place promptly after, 

the final date and time of the period for bid submission stipulated in the 

bidding documents. 

 

(d) Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to 

the responsive bidder who meets appropriate technical and financial 

standards of capability and whose bid has been determined to be the 

lowest evaluated bid. Such determination shall be made exclusively on 

the basis of the specifications, conditions and evaluation criteria 

stipulated in the bidding documents. If any factor additional to the 



- 13 - 

amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid evaluation, such 

factor or factors and the quantified manner on which they will be applied 

for purposes of determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely 

stipulated in the bidding documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and 

comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor shall 

be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, 

including correction of arithmetic errors. 

 

(e) The provisions of paragraph 2.46 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, 

more specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the 

persons officially charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating 

the bids while they are performing their official duties, without the 

corresponding bidder's written authorization. Moreover, bidders shall not 

be required to provide such authorization as a condition to be entitled to 

bid. This confidentiality requirement shall apply until the award of 

contract is notified to the successful bidder. Thereafter, confidentiality of 

the bids shall be limited to those bid portions for which confidentiality 

has been specifically requested by the bidder in question.

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 

percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal 

Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 

withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the 

Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be 

determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 

first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal 

Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 

Conversion applies.

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 

each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 

the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the 

Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 

of this Schedule. 

 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such 

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the 

amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 

the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 



- 15 - 

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original 

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 

Conversion applies. 

 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 

principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 

withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 

following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 

Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 

invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 

withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 

Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

 

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for 

each such amount.
