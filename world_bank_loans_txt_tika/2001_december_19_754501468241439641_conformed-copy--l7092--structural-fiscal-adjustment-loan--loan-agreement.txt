SCHEDULE 2

Amortization Schedule

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn 
as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by 
the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 



multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as 
of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal 
Payment Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies.

Installment Share
Payment Date (Expressed as a %)

On each May 15 and November 15

Beginning November 15, 2010 
       through May 15, 2015 10%

2. If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in 
the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the 
Original Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all 
remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after 
such date, such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two (2) calendar months prior to any Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable 
on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such 
sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the 
Loan to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that 
shall be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate 
that reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank 
under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank 
so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate 
component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

SCHEDULE 3

Actions Referred to in Section 2.02 (d) (ii) (C)

implemented in accordance with its terms, including by limiting the rate of growth of: 
(a) total transfers of resources to Territorial Entities to a rate equivalent to the 
rate of inflation in 2001 plus two percentage points; and (b) the operational 
expenditures of the entities of the Central Government set forth in Article 38,

to the rate of inflation in 2001 plus 1.5 percentage point.

debt and borrowing of Territorial Entities, is being implemented in accordance with

bailouts or guarantees of their debt, as provided in the Borrower’s Law No. 617, of 
October 6, 2000.

3. (a) The Borrower’s Law No. 60 of 1993 has been amended to provide for

and to establish education performance monitoring mechanisms; or (b) the Central 
Government has certified municipalities that, together with districts, represent at 
least 14 percent of the country’s school enrollment enabling such municipalities to 
autonomously manage the provision of education services (including teacher payroll), 
and performance agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, have been entered into between 
the Central Government and such certified districts and municipalities.  In either 
case, no extra budgetary transfers for education to such certified districts or 
municipalities shall have taken place.

4. The Central Government has signed and has started the implementation of 
contracts with at least three Territorial Entities to finance the restructuring of the  
hospitals of such Territorial Entities, such contracts to include specific annual 
targets for productivity increases in inpatient and outpatient services and labor cost 
reductions with a view to achieving, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, fiscal 
savings for such Territorial Entities equivalent to at least five percent per month on 
average, in real terms, in relation to the same period in 2001.

5. At least 60 percent of the health-related funds of the situado fiscal (budgetary 
transfers) (after deducting mandatory legal contributions) set forth in the Borrower’s 
budget for 2001 have been transformed to finance demand subsidies for health services.

6.  The Central Government and the ISS have reached an agreement to generate annual 
savings in ISS’s total costs over a ten-year period which will, in the opinion of the

public pension regimes into a single agency, reducing payments of ineligible pension

equivalent per month.

8. The Central Government’s total actual current expenditures (net of interest 
payments and transfers to Territorial Entities and to social security) that are being

in relation to the same expenditures incurred during the same period in 2001.

9. The Borrower’s budget approved for 2002 has included general expenditures (
gastos generales) that in real terms are not higher than those effectively incurred 
under the Borrower’s executed budget for 2001.
