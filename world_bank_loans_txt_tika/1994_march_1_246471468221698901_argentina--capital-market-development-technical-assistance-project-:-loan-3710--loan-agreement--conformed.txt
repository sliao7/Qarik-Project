Bank as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981 (the 
Consultant Guidelines). For complex, time-based assignments, the 

Borrower shall employ or cause to be employed such consultants under 

contracts using the standard form of contract for consultants’ 
services issued by the Bank, with such modifications as shall have 

been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract 

documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use or 
cause to be used other standard forms agreed with the Bank. 

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, 
the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank 
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, 
letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts 
shall not apply to contracts, under Part C.1 of the Project, 
estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each. However, this 
exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to the terms of 
reference for such contracts or to the employment of individuals, to 
single source selection of firms, to assignments of a critical 
nature as reasonably determined by the Bank or to amendments of 
contracts raising the contract value to $100,000 equivalent or 
above. 

3. In addition to the requirements of the Consultant Guidelines, 
no expenditures for training services shall be eligible for 
financing out of the proceeds of the Loan unless the application of 
the first-tier bank to BICE for financing of such services through 
the second-tier credit facility established under Part C.1 of the 
Project shall first have been approved by the Bank. 

4, To the extent possible, the Borrower shall employ or cause to 
be employed consultant firms in preference to individual consultants 
for the provision of consultant services for the Project.

SCHEDULE 6 

Special Account 

l. For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) the term "eligible Categories" means the Categories set 

forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; 

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in 
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for 
the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan 
allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance 
with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount 

equivalent to $700,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and 

deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this 
Schedule. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively 
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this 
Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that 
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the 
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a 
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan 

Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 
deposits into the Special Account at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, 

the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the 

documents and other evidence required pursuant 

  

 



  

  

- 24 - 

to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment 
or payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 

withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into 

the Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested and as shall have been 
shown by said documents and other evidence to 
have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures. 

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan 
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the 
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 

documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special 
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall 

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 
into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all 

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the 
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement; or 

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated 

to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding 
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal 
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories 

shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such 
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date 
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures. 

  
 



  

  

- 25 - 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure 
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 

deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 

refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 

shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 
Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account 

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General 
Conditions.
