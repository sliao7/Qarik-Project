made: 

(a) for payments made for Eligible Expenditures or Program Expenditures 
prior to the date of this Agreement; 

(b) under Categories (1) through (7), until and unless the Borrower has 
established an operational OMST, pursuant to Section I.A.(b) of this 
Schedule, in a manner and substance satisfactory to the Bank; and 

(c) for any DLR under Categories (1) through (6), until and unless the 

Borrower has furnished evidence satisfactory to the Bank that said DLR

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Part B.1(c) of this Section, the Borrower may, 
at any point in time and upon fulfilment of the condition precedent to 
disbursements set forth in Part B.1(b) of this Section, withdraw the proceeds of the

one or more DLRs for which the Borrower shall subsequently furnish to the Bank

withdrawn amounts out of the proceeds of the Loan and/or the Credit in excess of 
the Allocated Amount(s) authorized for disbursement as per Schedule 3 to this 

Agreement in respect of documented/achieved DLRs, the Bank shall require from 
the Borrower, and the Borrower shall refund to the Bank, the amount of such 

excess, promptly upon notice thereof by the Bank, in order for the Bank to proceed



oie

satisfied that any of the DLR(s) set forth in Schedule 3 of this Agreement has/have 
been achieved by the end of the Year in which said DLR(s) is/are set to be 
achieved, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, decide, in its sole discretion, 

to: 

(a) authorize the withdrawal of such lesser amount of the respective Allocated 
Amount(s) allocated to said DLR(s) which, in the opinion of the Bank, 
corresponds to the extent of achievement of said DLR(s); 

(b) authorize subsequent withdrawals of all or portion of the Allocated 
Amounts for said DLR(s) upon the Borrower’s achieving such DLRs at a 
later date; 

(c) reallocate all or a portion of the proceeds of the Allocated Amount for said 
DLR(s) to any other DLR(s); and/or 

(d) cancel all or a portion of the Allocated Amounts then allocated to said 
DLR(s). 

Withdrawal Reconciliations; Withdrawal Period

Closing Date the Borrower has failed to provide evidence satisfactory to the Bank 
that the aggregated amounts of the Withdrawn Loan Balance for Categories (1) 
through (6) (under the Loan) and the Withdrawn Financing Balance (under the 
Credit) do not exceed aggregated total amounts of Program Expenditures paid by 
the Borrower on account of the implementation of the Program (exclusive of any 
such expenditures financed by any other financier or by the Bank under any other 
loan, credit or grant), Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund 
to the Bank such excess amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance and/or the 
Withdrawn Financing Balance under Categories (1) through (6). Any such refunds 
will be first attributed to the Withdrawn Loan Balance and then to the Withdrawn 
Financing Balance. The Bank shall cancel the so refunded amounts from the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance and/or the Withdrawn Financing Balance, as the case 
may be.



-22-

to effect/account for such transfers pursuant to the provisions of Section 
1.G (above) of this Schedule; and 

capital expenditure shall only be considered part of the Program 
Expenditures once: (i) the Borrower has provided the Bank with all 
necessary information, as shall be/have been required by the Bank, for the 
Bank to assess the nature and need for such capital expenditures under the 
Program; and (ii) the Bank has thereafter confirmed in writing to the 

Borrower its concurrence with the inclusion in the Program Expenditures

SCHEDULE 4 

Amortization Schedule 

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the percentage 
of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date 
(“Installment Share”). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying: 
(a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment 
Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, 
to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

  

Principal Payment Date Installment Share 
(Expressed as a Percentage)   

On each May 15 and November 15 

Beginning May 15, 2027 3.33% 
through May 15, 2041 
  

  On November 15, 2041 3.43%       
If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment 
Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as 
of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date , such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 

(a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two (2) calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of



withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub- 
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs | and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency, 
the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal 
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the 
Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the 
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating 
to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 
provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan 
Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
