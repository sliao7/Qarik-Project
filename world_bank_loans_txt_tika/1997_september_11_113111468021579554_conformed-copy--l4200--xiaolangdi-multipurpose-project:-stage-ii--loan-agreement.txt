(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the

(B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so 
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the 
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further 
deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be 
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made 
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
