SCHEDULE 2

Description of the Project

The objectives of the Project are to continue to assist the
Borrower in developing a viable agricultural credit system and to
consolidate the gains already made in that direction, and, to
those ends: (a) to provide financial support for ADBP's credit
operations and for NCBs' agricultural credit operations; (b) to
enhance the institutional capabilities of PCIs so as to enable
them to deliver credit to an increasing proportion of the rural
community, including small-holder farmers, the landless and women,
and to become more efficient in credit supervision and collection;
(c) to enable ADBP to expand its resource base by developing its
rural deposit generating capabilities; and (d) to establish a
policy environment conducive to efficient financial intermediation
and to the existence of increasingly viable financial institutions
in the agricultural credit sector.

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
