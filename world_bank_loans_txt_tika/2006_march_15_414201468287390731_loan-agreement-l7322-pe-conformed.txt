promptly upon notice from the Bank, provide such additional evidence as the Bank may 
request, or deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the 
Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise 
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the 
Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

 (a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower, through

conditions in the Borrower’s territory. 

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objective: 

Part A: Participatory Regional Road Planning

1. Prepare or update participatory regional road plans, aligned with the existing 
regional development plans by:

Region; and 

(b) Analyzing the supply and demand for transport services and infrastructure and 
prioritize and evaluate road investment options towards identifying selected regional road 
segments. 

2. Carry out feasibility and technical studies for the selected regional road segments 
prioritized through participatory planning. 

Part B: Road Rehabilitation and Periodic Maintenance

1.  Rehabilitate about 2,200 km of the selected regional road segments prioritized 
through participatory regional road planning by contracting out the private sector to 
perform said rehabilitation works and related supervision on said selected regional road 
segments. 

2. Perform the periodic maintenance of: (i) about 2,700 km of selected regional 
road segments rehabilitated by PVR as the same are transferred to the Participating 
Regions; and (ii) other selected regional road segments as rehabilitated under the Project, 
by contracting out the private sector to perform said periodic maintenance and related 
supervision on said selected regional road segments.   



- 22 -

contracting out or force account options on said selected regional road segments as 
rehabilitated or periodically maintained under the Project. 

Part D: Institutional Strengthening

1. Provide technical assistance, training and equipment needed to upgrade 
Participating Regions’ institutional capacity by: 

(a) analyzing and rationalizing the current institutional framework in charge of 
regional road management of the Participating Regions;  

(b) supporting a transition from a system of direct administration of road 
maintenance and rehabilitation to a system where the private sector would be contracted 
out for these functions; 

(c) carrying out safeguard-related and fiduciary-related training activities on 
environmental, social, procurement and financial management issues; and 

(d) clarifying and strengthening regulatory responsibilities to be performed at 
regional level.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 
the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 
Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Payment Date Installment Share 
(Expressed as a %)

On each January 15 and July 15 
Beginning on July 15, 2013 through July 15, 
2018 
 

8.33% 

On January 15, 2019 8.37% 
 

2. If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original 
Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 



- 24 -

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such 
subparagraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either:  (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate.  

5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
