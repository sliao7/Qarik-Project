SCHEDULE 2 

Additional Provisions Relating to  
Particular Methods of Procurement 

 
Section I. National Competitive Bidding

Goods estimated to cost less than $300,000 equivalent per contract and works estimated 
to cost less than $5,000,000 equivalent per contract, may be procured under contracts awarded on 
the basis of National Competitive Bidding, subject to the following additional provisions: 
 

(a) Before issuing any invitation to bid, the Borrower shall use, or cause to be used, 
standard bidding documents, as approved by the Bank for bidding under the 
Project and incorporated in the Operational Manual (the “Standard Bidding 
Documents”). Any change or departure from the Standard Bidding Document 
approved by the Bank shall require its prior approval. 

 
(b) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or citizens of the 

Guarantor’s territory, will be treated equally and, particularly, no preference will 
be granted to any bidder or group of bidders for bid evaluation purposes. Bidders 
shall be allowed to submit their bids by hand or through the post office or private 
mailing services. There shall not be any requirement for any bidder to show 
evidence of the bidder's registration in any public registry, chamber of commerce 
or similar entity, whether in the Guarantor’s territory or elsewhere, or to appoint 
a representative domiciled in Guarantor’s territory, unless and until such bidder is 
awarded the corresponding contract. 

 
(c) Bids shall be opened in a public meeting to which bidders and their 

representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and place for 
the opening meeting shall be set forth in the bidding documents. Bid opening 
shall coincide with, or take place promptly after, the final date and time of the 
period for bid submission stipulated in the bidding documents. 

 
(d) Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to the 

responsive bidder who meets appropriate technical and financial standards of 
capability and whose bid has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid. 
Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the specifications, 
conditions and evaluation criteria stipulated in the bidding documents. If any 
factor additional to the amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid 
evaluation, such factor or factors and the quantified manner on which they will 
be applied for purposes of determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely 
stipulated in the bidding documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and 
comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor shall be the 
bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, including correction 
of arithmetic errors. 

 



- 19 -

(e) The provisions of paragraph 2.46 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, more 
specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the persons 
officially charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating the bids while 
they are performing their official duties, without the corresponding bidder’s 
written authorization. Moreover, bidders shall not be required to provide such 
authorization as a condition to be entitled to bid. This confidentiality requirement 
shall apply until the award of contract is notified to the successful bidder. 
Thereafter, confidentiality of the bids shall be limited to those bid portions for 
which confidentiality has been specifically requested by the bidder in question. 

 
Section II. Shopping

Contracts for goods or works estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent per contract 
may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of Shopping subject to the following 
additional provisions: 
 

(a) The Borrower shall obtain and compare at least three quotations to establish 
reasonableness of price. Comparison of two quotations is justified only when 
there is evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that there are only two reliable sources 
of supply (national or foreign as the case may be). For international shopping, the 
Borrower shall request quotations of suppliers from at least two different 
countries, including the country of the Guarantor. Quotation for foreign goods 
located in the Guarantor’s country and offered by a firm located in the 
Guarantor’s country, are considered as quoted from abroad for purposes of 
satisfying the “two different countries” rule. 

 
(b) The Borrower shall verify that the firms invited to quote are reputable, well 

established, and are suppliers of the goods or services being purchased as part of 
their normal business. 

 
(c) The Borrower shall request quotations by letter, fax, telex, electronic messaging, 

etc., (with proof of receipt and record keeping). Since quotation requests must be 
sent to reputable and well-established suppliers only, the requests should not be 
open to any other supplier and should not be made public. Suppliers shall submit 
their quotations in writing, (i.e., by fax, telex, letter, or electronic messaging with 
copies to be kept for the records).  No bid security is required.  There is no 
requirement for strict time and date for submission of quotations and for public 
opening, but normally requests for quotes indicate the expected date of 
submission of quotes, within one or two weeks of the initial request.

Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule,

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 



- 21 -

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
