This part of the Project comprises the following:

1. Sector-Wide Planning and Coordination. Strengthening of the Ministry’s 
capabilities on sector-wide planning and formulation, including clearer policy  and 
budgetary guidelines for transport sector for, and enhancing the supervision and 
reviewing by the Ministry of, GEIPOT’s work, and preparation  by GEIPOT of medium term 
strategic plans for the development and operation of three major transport corridors 
to be selected in agreement between the Borrower, acting through the Ministry and the 
Bank.

2. Reform and Strengthening of Highways Subsector Administration.
 

(a) Transferring responsibility on management and rehabilitation of some 
roads currently under the Borrower’s jurisdiction to the States and  consequential 
reorganization of DNER so as to strengthen DNER’s role, as national road agency, to 
coordinate the strategic development of Brazil road  network, and to provide 
technological leadership to the road subsector and standarized rules and procedures in 
order to avoid the inconsistencies, that in these areas, could accompany the aforesaid 
transference of responsibility, all in accordance with the chart set forth in Annex 1 
hereto. The  aforesaid  will also include overseeing and analyzing the said 
reorganization of the subsector and recommending the necessary changes as the 
reorganization proceeds, and the creation of a new Planning Unit in DNER and 
establishing its planning and coordination roles for the highways subsector as a whole 
and developing relevant procedures and methods.

(b) The aforesaid will be accompanied by the following measures, which, 
independently from those required to be taken as a consequence of (a) above,  will 
permit DNER to strengthen its current role, as national road agency, to coordinate the 
strategic development of Brazil road network, and to provide technological leadership 
to the road subsector and standardized rules and
procedures for the subsector: (i) detailing of areas of DNER’s operations which are 
not sufficiently clear now, such as job description and  accountability, and analyzing 
in detail DNER’s recruitment needs; (ii)  developing the 1991 to 1995 pluriannual

Agencies by means of: (A) developing a sound training policy and  program which 
emphasizes both technical, managerial and administrative training for DNER staff; (B) 
expanding DNER’s existing training facilities;  and (C) providing adequate and 
qualified manpower resources to train staff, including overseas and domestic training 
for DNER staff both in the technical and managerial areas, and acquisition for and 
utilization by DNER of training equipment; (vi) execution of a research program by 
DNER consisting of: (A)  pavement performance research linked with the international 
highway pavement  research program (SHRP) aimed at re-evaluating pavement design 
methods and performance; (B) development of new standards and procedures for pavements 
and overlays; (C) review and adaptation of management systems for structures; (D) 
development of the hydrological data base; (E) monitoring of slope estability;  (F) 
investigations of asphalt quality requirements and properties of asphalt  additives;

of GEIPOT which will enable the application of road-user charges which: (A) will have 
levels which will permit at least the recovery of short-term  marginal costs; (B) will 
be free of distortions detrimental to proper fuel conservation practices; and (C) will 
be subject to  updating in a timely fashion as required to achieve (A) and (B); (ii) 
reviewing the new structure and levels of road-user charges and recommending 
modifications thereto in light of the policy to be formulated under (i) above and 
recent development and changes in Brazil’s constitutional and fiscal laws; and (iii) 
designing and establishing a system to monitor the adequacy of  road-user charges. The 
aforesaid methods of adjustments to the road-user  charges system will reflect changes 
in road work costs and prices of the major user-charge components.

Procurement and Consultants’ Services

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works
 
Part A: International Competitive Bidding
 
1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be procured under 
contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those  set forth in 
Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD  Loans and IDA 
Credits" published by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines).

2. Contracts for works and goods shall be grouped, to the extent possible, so as to 
form bidding packages estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $7,500,000 and 
$250,000, respectively.

Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 
A 1 hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in 
accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions:

1. All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly  indicate any 
preference which would be granted, the information required to  establish the 
eligibility of a bid for such preference and the following  methods and stages that 
will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.

2. After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the following two 
groups:



(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the bidder shall 
have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that such goods 
contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the 
complete goods.

(2) Group B: bids offering any other goods.
 
3. In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, all evaluated bids 
in each group shall first be compared among themselves, without taking into account 
customs duties and other import taxes levied in connection  with the importation, and 
sales and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery, pursuant to 
the bids, of the goods. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be compared with each 
other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, it 
shall be selected for the award.

4. If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the lowest evaluated 
bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared with the lowest 
evaluated bid from group A after adding: (i) to the  C.I.F. bid price of goods to be 
imported in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the amount of 
customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay 
for the importation of the goods offered in such group B bid; or (B) 15% of the C.I.F. 
bid price of such goods, and (ii) to the ex-factory bid price of goods supplied 
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the 
amount  of customs duties and other import taxes which would be levied on the goods 
offered in such group B if they originated from the same foreign country as the bid 
included in group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import taxes, or 
(B) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. If, as a result of this comparison, 
the bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the 
lowest evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, shall be 
selected for the award.

Part C: Other Procurement Procedures
 
1. Contracts for: (a) civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of $7,500,000 or 
less; and (b) subject to the provision of paragraph 2 below, goods estimated to cost 
less than the equivalent of $250,000, may be awarded under competitive bidding 
procedures advertised only in Brazil to the extent that the procedures under which any 
such contract has been awarded are satisfactory to the Bank.

2. Contracts for goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $50,000, up to 
an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000, may be awarded to the 
lowest evaluated quotation following evaluation and comparison of quotations furnished 
by at least three (3) suppliers eligible under the Guidelines.

Part D: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
 
1. Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts:
 

(a) With respect to: (i) each contract for goods and civil works estimated to 
cost the equivalent of more than $100,000 and 7,500,000,  respectively, and (ii) 
contracts for civil works awarded pursuant to the provisions of Part C above, the 
procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall 
apply; provided, however, that should the first 2 sets of bidding documents for 
contracts under (ii) above and award recommendations thereon be satisfactory to the 
Bank, the provisions of this paragraph shall, unless otherwise determined by the Bank, 
cease to govern contracts awarded pursuant to (ii) above. Where payments for such 
contract  are to be made out of the Special Account, such procedures shall be modified 
to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract required to be furnished to 
the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the 
making of the first payment out of the Special Account in respect of such contract.

(b) With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding paragraph, 
the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the  Guidelines shall 
apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of the Special Account, 
said procedures shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the 
contract together with the other information
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be furnished 



to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of 
Schedule 5 to this Agreement.

2. The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of paragraph 4 of Appendix 1

Bank, or the Account Bank, as the  case may be, shall debit or cause to be debited, 
the CESA or the FESA, as  appropriate, with the dollar equivalent of the amount of the 
Eligible Expenditures in question in cruzeiros, in the case of the CESA, or the actual 
dollar amount, or the dollar equivalent of the Eligible Expenditures in currencies 
other than dollars or cruzeiros, in the case of the FESA.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the CESA and the 
FESA have been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the CESA or the FESA shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the corresponding amount of the Authorized Allocation, 
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits 
which do not exceed the corresponding amount of the  Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit in the CESA or FESA, as the case may be, such amount 
or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the CESA or FESA, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank requests for deposits into the CESA or FESA at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify.
 



(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the CESA or FESA, as the case may be, such amount as 
the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown by 
said documents and other evidence to have been made out of the CESA or 
FESA, as the case may be, for Eligible Expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under  the 
respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts,  as shall 
have been justified by said documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the CESA or the FESA, as the case 
may be, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish 
to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that  such payment was made 
exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into either the CESA or the FESA:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the aggregate 
of Eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered 
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General  Conditions with respect to 
the Project, shall be equal to the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized 
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 
amount of the Loan allocated to the corresponding Eligible Categories shall follow 
such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further 
withdrawals shall be  made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied  that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the CESA or the FESA, as the 
case may be, as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments
for Eligible Expenditures.

6. (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
either the CESA or the  FESA: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not 
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not  justified by the 
evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the CESA or the FESA, as the case may be, (or, if the 
Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such 
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the CESA or the FESA, as the case 
may be, shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time, that any amount 
outstanding in either the CESA or the FESA will not be required to cover further 
payments for the corresponding Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower  shall, promptly 
upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the CESA or the FESA.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of  this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
