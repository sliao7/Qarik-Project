Description of the Project

The main objective of the Project is to consolidate and extend the gains made 
under the Prior Project in: (i) strengthening research capacity in specific science 
areas including human resource development; and (ii) institutional reform by 
decentralizing science decision-making, including using peer review mechanisms for 
selecting Sub-projects. A second objective of the Project is to strengthen the policy 
decision-making processes and management of the Borrower’s science and technology 
sector as well as to help improve the environment for technological innovation in the 
private sector.

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 
thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives:

SCHEDULE 4

Procurement and Consultants’ Services

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works

Part A: International Competitive Bidding

1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods shall be procured under contracts 
awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in  Sections I 



and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published 
by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines).

2. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped in bidding 
packages estimated to cost the equivalent to $250,000 or more so as to permit 
international competitive bidding.

Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 
A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in 
accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the 
Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto, provided, however, that:

1. All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly indicate any 
preference which would be granted, the information required to establish the 
eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the following methods and stages that will be followed in the 
evaluation and comparison of bids.

2. After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the following two 
groups:

(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the bidder shall 
have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that such 
goods contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of 
the value of the complete goods.

(2) Group B: bids offering any other goods.

3. In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, all evaluated bids 
in each group shall first be compared among themselves, without taking into account 
customs duties and
other import taxes levied in connection with the importation, or the sales and similar 
taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of the goods pursuant to the 
bids. Such lowest evaluated
bids shall then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a 
bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award.

4. If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the lowest evaluated 
bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared with the lowest 
evaluated bid from group A after adding: (i) to the evaluated bid price of goods to be 
imported in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the amount of 
customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay 
for the importation of the goods offered in such group B bid or (B) 15% of the c.i.f. 
bid price of such goods; and (ii) to the ex-factory bid price of goods supplied 
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the 
amount of customs duties and other import taxes which would be levied on the goods 
offered in such group B if they originated from the same foreign country as the bid 
included in group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other importtaxes, or 
(B) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. If, as a result of this comparison, 
the bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the 
lowest evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, shall be 
selected for the award.

Part C: Other Procurement Procedures
 
1. Goods, estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $250,000 but more than the 
equivalent of $25,000, and civil works may be procured under contracts awarded on the 
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally, in accordance with procedures 
satisfactory to the Bank.

2. Contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $25,000 or less may be 
awarded under the procurement procedures referred to in paragraph 3.4 of the 
Guidelines.

3. Contracts for specialized equipment provided by a limited number of suppliers, 



not exceeding in the aggregate the equivalent of $34,300,000, may be awarded under the 
procurement procedures
referred to in paragraph 3.2 of the Guidelines.

4. Goods which are proprietary in nature, not exceeding in the aggregate the 
equivalent of $6,200,000, may be purchased directly from the supplier.

Part D: Review of Procurement Decisions by the Bank
 
1. Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts:
 

(a) With respect to: (i) each contract to be awarded pursuant to the 
provisions of Part C.3 of this Section and costing the equivalent of $250,000 or more 
or Part A of this Section, and
(ii) the first two contracts for goods to be awarded pursuant to the provisions of 
Part C.1 of this Section, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 
to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for any such contracts are to be made 
out of the proceeds of CESA or FESA, such procedures shall be modified to ensure that 
the two conformed copies of the contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant 
to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the 
first payment out of CESA or FESA in respect of such contract.

(b) With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding paragraph, 
the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall 
apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of CESA or FESA, such 
procedures shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract 
together with the other information required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to 
said paragraph 3 shall be furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be 
furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall not apply to 
contracts on account of which the Bank has authorized withdrawals from the Loan 
Account on the basis of statements of expenditure.

2. The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 
to the Guidelines.

Part E: Other
 

For purposes of this Schedule and the Guidelines, the term "customs duties and 
other import taxes" includes the FSRMM.

Section II. Employment of Consultants
 

In order to assist the Borrower and the Entities in the carrying out of the 
Project and the Beneficiaries in the carrying out of their Sub-projects, the Borrower, 
the Entities or the Beneficiaries, as the case may be, shall employ consultants whose 
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be 
satisfactory to the Bank, such consultants shall be
selected in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the 
basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The 
World Bank as Executing
Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981.

SCHEDULE 5

Special Accounts: CESA and FESA

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:
 

(a) the term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1) and (2) set forth in 
the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

(b) the term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan
allocated from time to time to the Eligible Categories in accordance with the 



provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to 
$18,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into CESA and FESA 
($6,000,000 equivalent into CESA and $12,000,000 equivalent into FESA) pursuant to 
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.

2. Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of CESA and FESA, as the 
case may be, shall be made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 2.02 of this Agreement and of this Schedule. Withdrawals 
from CESA or FESA shall be made on the basis of evidence that the Bank shall have 
reasonably determined. For each such withdrawal, the Central Bank or the Account Bank, 
as the case may be, shall debit or cause to be debited, CESA or FESA, as appropriate, 
with the dollar equivalent of the amount of the Eligible Expenditures in question in 
Cruzeiros, in the case of CESA, or the actual dollar amount, or the dollar equivalent 
of the Eligible Expenditures in currencies other than dollars or Cruzeiros, in the 
case of FESA.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that CESA or FESA have 
been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals 
to replenish CESA or FESA shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the 
aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on 
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into CESA or FESA, 
as the case may be, such
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of CESA or FESA, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank requests for deposits into CESA or FESA at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify.
 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into CESA or FESA, as the case may be, such amount as the 
Borrower shall have requested and as shall

have been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been 
paid out of CESA or FESA, as the case may be, for Eligible Expenditures.
 
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the 
respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of CESA or FESA, as the case may be, 
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the 
Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively 
for Eligible Expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into CESA or FESA:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the Eligible 
Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, 
shall be equal to the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.



Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in CESA or FESA, as the case may be, as of the date of such 
notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
either CESA or FESA: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence 
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into CESA or 
FESA (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the 
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the 
Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into CESA and FESA shall be 
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as 
the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in either CESA or FESA will not be required to cover further payments for Eligible 
Expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in CESA or FESA.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
