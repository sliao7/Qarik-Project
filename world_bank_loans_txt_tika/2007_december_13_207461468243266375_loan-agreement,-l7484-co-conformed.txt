Competitive Bidding subject to the following additional procedures:   

 
(a) Before issuing any invitation to bid, the Recipient shall prepare and furnish or 

cause to be prepared and furnished to the Bank for approval, appropriate model 
bidding documents.  Once approved by the Bank, the Recipient shall use, or 
cause to be used, said model bidding documents, as approved for bidding under

Bank’s prior approval.  

(b) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or Colombians, will be 
treated equally and, particularly, no preference will be granted to any bidder or 
group of bidders for bid evaluation purposes.  Bidders shall be allowed to submit

registration in any public registry, chamber of commerce or similar entity,

domiciled in the Beneficiary’s territory, unless and until such bidder is awarded

Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the specifications, 
conditions and evaluation criteria stipulated in the bidding documents. If any 
factor additional to the amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid 
evaluation, such factor or factors and the quantified manner in which they will be 
applied for purposes of determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely 
stipulated in the bidding documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and 
comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor shall be the

bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, including correction 
of arithmetic errors. 

(e) The provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, more 
specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the persons 
officially charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating the bids while 
they are performing their official duties, without the corresponding bidder’s 
written authorization. Moreover, bidders shall not be required to provide such 
authorization as a condition to be entitled to bid. This confidentiality requirement

Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

 
(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 

 
3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 



-15- 

 

amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 

time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
