                have requested and as shall have been shown by
                aid documents and other evidence to have been
                paid out of the Special Account for eligible
                expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by
said documents and other evidence.

4.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.

5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:

    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that
all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

    (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the



Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;

    (c)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or

    (d)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all
outstand-ing special commitments entered into by the Bank
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to Parts A of the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice
the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories for Part A of the Project shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the
extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for
eligible expenditures.

6.  (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account:

          (i)   was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
                eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
                Schedule; or

          (ii)  was not justified by the evidence furnished to
                the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
                notice from the Bank:

                (A)   provide such additional evidence as the Bank
                      may request; or

                (B)   deposit into the Special Account (or, if the
                      Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
                      an amount equal to the amount of such                      
payment or the portion thereof not so
                      eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall
                      otherwise agree, no further deposit by the
                      Bank into the Special Account shall be made
                      until the Borrower has provided such
                      evidence or made such deposit or refund, as
                      the case may be.

    (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required
to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to
the Bank such outstanding amount.

    (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to
the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the
Special Account.

    (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
