SCHEDULE 2

Amortization Schedule

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the percentage

of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date

("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first

Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on

each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:

(a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment
Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency

Conversion applies.

Principal Payment Date Installment Share
(Expressed as a Percentage)

On each January 15 and July 15
Beginning January 15, 2021 2.50%
through July 15, 2040

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment

Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal

Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as

of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts

determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the

table in paragraph I of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original
Installment Share") and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining

Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts

referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion

applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts

payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding

on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall

be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any

time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on



-9-

or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-

paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such

billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal

Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by

multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the

Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the

Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating

to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan

Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
