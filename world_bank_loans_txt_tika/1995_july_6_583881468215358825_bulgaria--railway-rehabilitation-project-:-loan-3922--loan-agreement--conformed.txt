validity period if the period of extension exceeds sixty (60) days, and (ii) any subsequent

of the Guidelines shall provide that, when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid 

validity period, the successful bidder's bid price will be increased for each week of delay by 

two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign 

currency components and the other to the local currency component of the bid price. Such 

an increase shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. 

(c) In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part A, the Borrower 

shall use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such 

modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the
