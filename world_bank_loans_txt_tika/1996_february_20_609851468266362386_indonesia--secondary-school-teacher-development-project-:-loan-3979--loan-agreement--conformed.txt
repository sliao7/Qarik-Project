2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible

withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall

furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an

amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized

amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund,
as the case may be.
