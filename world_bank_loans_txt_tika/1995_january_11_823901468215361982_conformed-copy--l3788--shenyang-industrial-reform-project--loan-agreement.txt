SCHEDULE 4

Special Account

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:
 

(a) the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1), (2) and (3) set 



forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for Investment Projects and for Parts 
A, B.1 and C of the Project to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated 
from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement, provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions 
of paragraph 2 (b) of Schedule 1 to the Financial Intermediaries
Project Agreement, payments for expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of 
free-limit Sub-loans may be made out of the Special Account before the Bank shall have 
authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account in respect thereof. Such expenditures, 
however, shall qualify as eligible expenditures only if the Bank shall subsequently 
authorize such withdrawals; and

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to 
$10,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the Special Account 
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the 
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have 
requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account 
at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.
 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is requested.  On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan 
Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as the 
Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown by 
said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the 
Special Account for eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the 
respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower 
shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent 



of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be 
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished 
to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account 
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall 
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, 
as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.

SCHEDULE 5

modified as follows:

(1) The last sentence of Section 3.02 is deleted.
 
(2) The following subparagraph is added to Section 2.01:
 

"21. The term ’Financial Intermediaries Project Agreement’ has the 
meaning set forth in paragraph (f) of Section 1.02 of the Loan Agreement."
 
(3) The words "the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Guarantor, terminate 
the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals with respect to such amount. Upon the 
giving of such notice, such amount of the Loan shall be cancelled" set forth at the 
end of Section 6.03 are deleted and the following is substituted therefor:

"or (e) by the date specified in subparagraph 3(b) of Schedule 1 to the 
Financial Intermediaries Project Agreement, the Bank shall, in respect of 
any portion of the Loan: (i) have received no applications or requests permitted 
under subparagraphs (a) or (b) of said paragraph; or (ii) have denied any such 
applications or requests, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and Guarantor, 
terminate the right to submit such applications or approvals or to make withdrawals 
from the Loan Account, as the case may be, with respect to such amount or portion of 
the Loan.  Upon the giving of such notice, such amount or portion of the Loan shall 
be cancelled."

SCHEDULE 6

Single Currency LIBOR Determination



1. Single Currency LIBOR for any Interest Period shall be the offered rate for 
deposits in dollars for a period of six months which appears on the display designated 
as page "3750" on the Telerate monitor (or such other page or service as may replace 
it for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks for 
dollars deposits), as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second day on which banks and 
foreign exchange markets are open for business in London prior to the relevant January 
15 or July 15 (the Interest Determination Date).

2. If such rate does not appear on the Telerate monitor or on such service as may 
replace it, the Bank shall request the London offices of four major banks to provide 
the Bank with the rate at which deposits in dollars are offered by such banks on the 
Interest Determination Date to leading banks in the London interbank market for a 
period of six months ending on the last day of such Interest Period.  Single Currency 
LIBOR for such Interest Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if 
necessary to the fifth decimal place) of such offered quotations as determined by the 
Bank.

3. If not more than one major bank provides the Bank with such quotations under 
paragraph 2 above, Single Currency LIBOR shall be arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if 
necessary to the fifth
decimal place) determined by the Bank of the rates quoted by at least two major banks 
in New York City selected by the Bank on the Interest Determination Date for loans in 
dollars to leading European banks for a period of six months ending on the lastday  of 
such Interest Period. If fewer than two of the banks so selected are quoting such 
rates, Single Currency LIBOR shall be the single currency in effect for the last 
preceding Interest Period.
