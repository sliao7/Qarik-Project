this Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the proceeds of the Loan from 
the Loan Account in support of the Program. 

(b) The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank the first

All withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit 
Account.

(c) The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used 
to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan 
shall have been used to make a payment for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment, or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, 
refund such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall

the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and pay to 
itself the amount of said service charge.

the Borrower shall pay to the Bank a further service charge in an amount equal to: (i) 
one percent (1%) of the original principal amount of the Loan, payable on the first 
anniversary of the Effective Date; and (ii) one half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) of the 
original principal amount of the Loan, payable on the second anniversary of the 
Effective Date.

(f) Without limitation to Section 3.04(b) of the General Conditions, any 
portion of the service charges not yet paid under Sections 2.02(d) and (e) of this 
Loan Agreement shall become immediately due and payable upon:  (i) any cancellation of 
the Loan under Section 6.01 or Section 6.03 of the General Conditions; or (ii) any 
prepayment under Section 3.04(b) of the General Conditions.

Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be February 28, 1998 or such later date as 
the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later 
date.

Section 2.04. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment charge at the rate 
of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per annum on the principal amount of the 
Loan not withdrawn from time to time. 

Section 2.05. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a rate for each Interest Period 
equal to LIBOR Base Rate plus one percent (1%).

(b) For the purposes of this Section: 

(i) “Interest Period” means the initial period from and 
including the date of this Agreement to, but excluding, the 

first Interest Payment Date occurring thereafter, and after the 
initial period, each period from and including an Interest Payment 
Date to, but excluding the next following Interest Payment Date. 

(ii) “Interest Payment Date” means any date specified in Section 
2.06 of this Agreement. 

(iii) “LIBOR Base Rate” means, for each Interest Period, the 
London interbank offered rate for six-month deposits in 

Dollars for value the first day of such Interest Period (or, in the 
case of the initial Interest Period, for value the Interest Payment 
Date occurring on or next preceding the first day of such Interest 
Period), as reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a 
percentage per annum. 

(c) The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate for each Interest 
Period, promptly upon the determination thereof. 

(d) Whenever, in light of changes in market practice affecting the 
determination of the interest rates referred to in this Section 2.05, the Bank 
determines that it is in the interest of its borrowers as a whole and of the Bank to 
apply a basis for determining the interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as 
provided in said Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest 
rates applicable to the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower 
of the new basis. The basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice period 
unless the Borrower notifies the Bank during said period of its objection thereto, in 
which case said modification shall not apply to the Loan.

Section 2.06. Interest and other charges shall be payable semiannually on March 
15 and September 15 in each year. 

Section 2.07. The Borrower shall repay the principal amount of the Loan in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2 to this Agreement.
