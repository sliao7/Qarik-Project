to 

SCHEDULE 2 

Additional Provisions Relating to  
Particular Methods of Procurement 

Section I. Goods, Works, Non-Consulting Services and Technical Services

Without limitation upon the provisions of Schedule 2 to this Agreement or the 
Procurement Guidelines, the following additional provisions shall apply to all goods, 
works, Non-Consulting Services, and Technical Services procured for the Project 
(pursuant to Section III.A.1 of Schedule 2 to this Agreement) under contracts awarded on 
the basis of National Competitive Bidding (“NCB Contracts”): 

1. The Borrower shall cause the RIC, through the Subsidiary Agreement, to submit 
all forms and models of requests for quotations and bidding documents that the 
RIC proposes to use for the procurement of goods, works, Non-Consulting 
Services, and Technical Services under NCB Contracts (the “Model Bidding 
Documents”) to the Bank for its approval before the RIC issues its first invitation 
for bids for any of the NCB Contracts for the Project.  Except as the Bank shall 
otherwise agree, neither the Borrower nor the RIC shall revise or otherwise 
modify or change the Model Bidding Documents that have been approved by the 
Bank in accordance with the foregoing sentence (the “Approved Bidding 
Documents”).   

2. Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to the 
responsive bidder: (a) who meets the appropriate technical and financial 
standards or capabilities; and (b) whose bid has been determined to be the lowest 
evaluated bid. Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the 
specifications, conditions and evaluation criteria stipulated in the Approved 
Bidding Documents.  If the bid evaluation will consider any factor other than the 
amount or amounts of each bid, the Approved Bidding Documents will precisely 
stipulate and describe each such factor, including, inter alia, the manner in which 
such factor will be quantified and given a relative weight for purposes of 
determining the lowest evaluated bid.  The award of contracts for goods, works, 
Non-Consulting Services, and Technical Services shall be based exclusively on 
price and, whenever appropriate, shall also take into account factors similar to 
those referred to in paragraph 2.52 of the Procurement Guidelines; provided, 
however, that the bid evaluation shall always be based on factors that can be 
quantified objectively, and the procedure for such quantification shall be 
disclosed in the invitation to bid. For purposes of bid evaluation and comparison, 
the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor shall be the bid amount or 
amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, as such bid may be corrected by the 
Borrower for arithmetic errors. 



-24- 

 

3. Foreign bidders shall be allowed to participate and shall not, as a condition for 
participating in the bidding process, be required to: 

(a) be registered in the Borrower’s territory;

(c) enter into a joint venture agreement with local bidders; or 

(d) legalize their bids or any documentation related to such bids with an 
embassy or consulate of the Borrower, the Borrower’s Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, or any other governmental authority or representative of 
the Borrower, as a pre-condition to participating in the bidding process. 

4. No reference value shall be required for publication in the bidding documents 
and call for bids. 

5. Any standards and technical specifications (quoted in the bidding documents) 
which are at least substantially equivalent to the standards and technical 
specifications of the Borrower or the RIC shall be acceptable. 

6. No minimum number of responsive proposals shall be required prior to awarding 
a contract for goods or works. 

7. No margin of preference shall be granted for any particular category of bidders.

SCHEDULE 3 
 

Amortization Schedule 
 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the 
Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency

the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such 
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original 
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

 
3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 



-27- 

 

principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

 
5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for 
each such amount.
