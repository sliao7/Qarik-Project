Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the amount of the Loan from the Loan 
Account in support of the Program. 

(b)  The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank the first request

deposit account in Dollars on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.  All 
withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit 
Account. 

(c) The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used 
to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement.  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan 
shall have been used to make a payment for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment; or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, refund 
such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be 
credited to the Loan Account for cancellation. 

(d) No withdrawals shall be made from the Loan Account after the aggregate 
of the proceeds of the Loan withdrawn from the Loan Account shall have reached the 
amount of $10,300,000, unless the Bank shall be satisfied, after an exchange of views as 
described in Section 3.01 of this Agreement based on evidence satisfactory to the Bank: 

(A) with the progress achieved by the Borrower in the carrying out 
of the Program; 

(B) that the macroeconomic policy framework of the Borrower is 
satisfactory, as measured on the basis of indicators agreed 
between the Borrower and the Bank; and 



- 4 -

(C) that the actions described in Schedule 3 to this Agreement have 
been taken. 

If, after said exchange of views, the Bank is not so satisfied, the Bank may give notice to 
the Borrower to that effect and, if within 90 days after such notice, the Borrower shall not 
have taken steps satisfactory to the Bank, in respect of (A), (B), and (C) above, as the 
case may be, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn 
amount of the Loan or any part thereof. 

Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be June 30, 2005, or such later date as the 
Bank shall establish.  The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later date. 

Section 2.04. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a fee in an amount equal to one 
percent (1%) of the amount of the Loan.  On or promptly after the Effective Date, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and pay to itself 
the amount of said fee.  

Section 2.05. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment charge at the 
rate of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per annum on the principal amount of the 
Loan not withdrawn from time to time. 

Section 2.06. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a rate for each Interest Period 
equal to LIBOR Base Rate plus LIBOR Total Spread. 

(b) For the purposes of this Section: 

(i) “Interest Period” means the initial period from and including the

Payment Date occurring thereafter, and after the initial period,

excluding the next following Interest Payment Date. 

(ii) “Interest Payment Date” means any date specified in Section 
2.07 of this Agreement.

interbank offered rate for six-month deposits in Dollars for value 
the first day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of the initial 
Interest Period, for value the Interest Payment Date occurring on 
or next preceding the first day of such Interest Period), as 



- 5 -

reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a 
percentage per annum. 

(iv) “LIBOR Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: (A) 
three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%); (B) minus (or plus) the 
weighted average margin, for such Interest Period, below (or 
above) the London interbank offered rates, or other reference 
rates, for six-month deposits, in respect of the Bank’s 
outstanding borrowings or portions thereof allocated by the Bank 
to fund single currency loans or portions thereof made by it that 
include the Loan; as reasonably determined by the Bank and 
expressed as a percentage per annum. 

(c) The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate and LIBOR 
Total Spread for each Interest Period, promptly upon the determination thereof. 

(d) Whenever, in light of changes in market practice affecting the 
determination of the interest rates referred to in this Section, the Bank determines that it 
is in the interest of its borrowers as a whole and of the Bank to apply a basis for 
determining the interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as provided in said 
Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest rates applicable to 
the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower of the new basis.  The 
basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice period unless the Borrower 
notifies the Bank during said period of its objection thereto, in which case said 
modification shall not apply to the Loan. 

Section 2.07. Interest and commitment charges shall be payable semiannually in 
arrears on May 15 and November 15 in each year.
