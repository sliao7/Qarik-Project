SCHEDULE 2

Description of the Project

The objectives of the Project are to support the Borrower's
efforts in: (a) reducing electricity subsidies in a sustainable
manner; (b) reforming the legal and regulatory framework of the
electricity and telecommunications sectors so as to ensure a
complete separation of state policy and regulatory functions from
state commercial activities in such sectors; (c) strengthening (or
establishing and strengthening) the public institutions in charge of
such policy and regulatory functions; and (d) privatizing the
provision of telecommunication and electricity services in Ecuador.

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:

Part A: Institutional Strengthening

1. Strengthening of CONAM's institutional capacity to: (a)
coordinate and supervise, as well as promote legal changes required
for, the reform measures covered by Parts B and C of the Project
with respect to the electricity and telecommunications sectors and
the proper utilization of proceeds derived from privatizations in
such sectors; and (b) in general carry out more effectively its
legally assigned function as coordinator of public enterprise reform
efforts in Ecuador.

2. Development and implementation of promotional campaigns to
highlight the need for public enterprise reform, encourage private
investment in economic activities formerly carried out by public
enterprises and expose key public officials (through trips and
seminars) to the privatization processes which have occurred in
countries other than Ecuador.

Part B: Telecommunications Sector

1. Reform of the telecommunications sector policy and regulatory
framework to facilitate properly regulated private sector provision
of telecommunication services in Ecuador.

2. (a) Institutional strengthening of the public entities in
charge of policy and regulatory functions in the telecommunications
sector (including the provision of training to such entities'



- 17 -

personnel); (b) granting of licenses to telecommunication service
providers; and (c) improvement of radio spectrum management through
establishment of a radio frequency licensee data base, monitoring of
frequency emissions, improved control of the spectrum and assignment
of new frequencies.

3. Technical assistance for purposes of preparing for the
privatization of, and actually privatizing, the provision of
telecommunication services which currently are legally offerable by
EMETEL, such privatization to occur through concession arrangements
(which arrangements shall, if legally possible, be accompanied by
sale to the private sector of the assets of, or shares in, EMETEL).

4. Technical assistance for purposes of analyzing and executing
the possible privatization of telecommunication services offered to
the public by municipalities in Ecuador.

Part C: Electricity Sector

1. Reform of the electricity sector policy and regulatory
framework to facilitate properly regulated and environmentally sound
private sector provision of electricity services in Ecuador.

2. Institutional strengthening of the public entities in charge
of policy and regulatory functions in the electricity sector
(including the provision of training to such entities' personnel).

3. Technical assistance (including environmental technical
assistance) for purposes of: (a) restructuring INECEL (and all other
entities in the electricity sector over which the Borrower, directly
or indirectly, has managerial control) by creating separate
generation corporations, a separate transmission corporation and
separate distribution corporations; and (b) preparing for the
privatization of, and actually privatizing, the provision of
electricity services which currently are legally offerable by INECEL
and said entities, such privatization to occur through concession
arrangements (which arrangements shall, if legally possible, be
accompanied by sale to the private sector of the assets of, or
shares in, INECEL and said entities).

Part A: International Competitive Bidding

1. Goods shall be procured under contracts awarded in accordance
with procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II
of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines), and in
accordance with the following additional procedures:

(a) When contract award is delayed beyond the original bid
validity period, such period may be extended once, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.59 of the Guidelines,
by the minimum amount of time required to complete the evaluation,
obtain necessary approvals and clearances and award the contract.
The bid validity period may be extended a second time only if the
bidding documents or the request for extension shall provide for
appropriate adjustment of the bid price to reflect changes in the
cost of inputs for the contract over the period of extension. Such
an increase in the bid price shall not be taken into account in the
bid evaluation.

(b) With respect to each contract made subject to the Bank's
prior review in accordance with the provisions of Part B of this
Section, the Bank's prior approval will be required for: (i) a first
extension of the bid validity period if the period of extension
exceeds sixty days; and (ii) any subsequent extension of the bid
validity period.

2. In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part A,
the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding documents
issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank
shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Project.
Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the
Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based on other
internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the Bank.

Part B: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions

1. With respect to each contract for goods, the procedures set
forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall



- 21 -

apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of the
Special Account, such procedures shall be modified to ensure that
the two conformed copies of the contract required to be furnished to
the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the
Bank prior to the making of the first payment out of the Special
Account in respect of such contract.

2. The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines.

Section II. Employment of Consultants

1. In order to assist the Borrower in carrying out the Project,
the Borrower shall employ or cause to be employed consultants (to
provide consulting or training services) whose qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be
satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank
on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published
by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines). For complex,
time-based assignments, the Borrower shall employ or cause to be
employed such consultants under contracts using the standard form of
contract for consultants' services issued by the Bank, with such
modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where no
relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank,
the Borrower shall use or cause to be used other standard forms
agreed with the Bank.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section,
the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures,
letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts
shall not apply to: (a) contracts for the employment of consulting
firms estimated to cost less than $75,000 equivalent each; or (b)
contracts for the employment of individuals estimated to cost less
than $30,000 equivalent each. However, this exception to prior Bank
review shall not apply to: (a) the terms of reference for such
contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c)
assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined by the
Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting
firms raising the contract value to $75,000 equivalent or above; or
(e) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual
consultants raising the contract value to $30,000 equivalent or
above.

Section III. Special Provisions

A. In addition and without limitation to any other provisions set
forth in this Schedule or the Guidelines, the following principles
of procurement shall expressly govern all procurement of goods
referred to in Part A of Section I of this Schedule:

1. Bids must be submitted in one single envelope, and the name of
each bidder and the total amount of each bid, as well as any
alternative proposals, if they have been requested or permitted,
shall be read aloud when opened.

2. Foreign bidders must not be required to have a local
representative for purposes of submitting bids, but may be required
to have such a representative upon entering into contracts which
they have been awarded.

3. Foreign bidders must be permitted to have their financial
solvency certified by a foreign bank acceptable to the Borrower
without recertification by any Ecuadorian bank or other Ecuadorian
person or entity.

4. Bid and performance bonds and guarantees issued by foreign
sureties approved by the Borrower must be admissible without
recertification or other participation by any Ecuadorian bank or
other Ecuadorian person or entity.

5. Letters of credit issued to any supplier of goods or provider
of services must not be required to be counter-guaranteed by such
supplier or provider in whole or in part. This shall not prevent
purchasers from obtaining other performance warranties from
suppliers.

set forth in this Schedule or the Consultants Guidelines, the
following principles of procurement shall expressly govern all
procurement of consultants' services referred to in Section II of
this Schedule:

2. Foreign consultants must not be required, either directly or
indirectly, to give any participation in or share of any consulting
contracts to any local firm or person, except in connection with a
joint venture arrangement where: (i) a sufficient number of capable
domestic firms or individual consultants exist to allow a foreign
consultant reasonable freedom of choice; (ii) the contribution of
either party to the joint venture arrangement will not be
constrained by any prescribed manner or extent of participation; and
(iii) the foreign consultant is not required to associate itself
with any specific named domestic firms or individual consultants.

3. Foreign consulting firms shall not be required, as a condition
to provide services in Ecuador under contracts to be financed out of
the proceeds of the Loan, to be registered in Ecuador with a minimum
capital different from that required for Ecuadorian firms.

4. Foreign consultants, either individuals or firms, providing
services under contracts financed out of the proceeds of the Loan,
shall not be required to pay fees to the Ecuadorian Consultants'
Association that are different from those required for Ecuadorian
consultants.

Section IV. Internal Approvals

To the extent any approval of bidding documents or contracts
(with respect to the procurement of goods to be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan) may be required under the laws of the
Borrower, such approval need be given only by CONAM. In addition,
with regard to the employment of consultants to be financed out of
the proceeds of the Loan, any approval of contracts or of consultant
selection processes, required under the laws of the Borrower, need
be given only by CONAM.

SCHEDULE 5

Special Account

1. For the purposes of this Schedule,

(a) the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1)
through (5) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement;

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for
the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance
with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
equivalent to $1,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this
Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount
equivalent to $500,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals
from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the
equivalent of $2,000,000.

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as
the Borrower shall have requested.



- 25 -

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
deposits into the Special Account at such
intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
documents and other evidence required pursuant
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment
or payments in respect of which replenishment is
requested. On the basis of each such request,
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into
the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
shall have requested and as shall have been
shown by said documents and other evidence to
have been paid out of the Special Account for
eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii)
of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished
to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the
records and accounts for the Special Account;



- 26 -

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right
of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant
to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding

special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal

the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to

the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such

amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date

of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this

Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)

provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank

shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such

evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to

cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower

shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such

outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),

(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account



- 27 -

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
