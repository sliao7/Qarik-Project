of this Schedule. 

 
(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original 
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which
