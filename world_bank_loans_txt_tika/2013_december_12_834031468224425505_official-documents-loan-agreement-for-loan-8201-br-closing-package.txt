1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Part A of this Section, no withdrawal shall be 
made: 

(a) for payments made prior to the date of this Agreement, except that 

withdrawals up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $50,000,000 
equivalent may be made for payments made up to twelve months prior to 

such date but on or after January 1, 2012, for Eligible Expenditures under 
Category (1); and 

(b) for payments made under Category (1) unless: 

(i) the relevant EEP Spending Report, as referred to in Section. I. 

C.1. of this Schedule, shall have been submitted to, and found 

satisfactory by, the Bank, in accordance with the provisions of 
the Project Operational Manual and the additional instructions 
referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule; and 

(ii) the applicable Budget Execution Rule, and any applicable 
Disbursement-Linked Indicators have been met by the Borrower 

in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank, all as set forth in 

the Project Operational Manual and in the additional instructions 
referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule. 

-21- 

 



If the Bank has not received evidence of full compliance with the Budget 

Execution Rule, in respect to any Loan withdrawal under Category (1), other than 

for the first, second, seventh and eighth application for withdrawal (as referred to 

in the Project Operational Manual and additional instructions referred to in 

Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule) then, the planned disbursement amount shall be 

reduced applying the Execution Coefficient in the applicable value set forth in 

the Project Operational Manual and additional instructions referred to in Section 

IV.A.1 of this Schedule; all as set forth therein. 

If the Bank has not received evidence of full compliance with the DLIs, in 

respect to any Loan withdrawal under Category (1), other than for the first 
application for withdrawal then, the planned disbursement amount (after the 

application of the Budget Execution Rule above) for the third, fourth, fifth and 
sixth application for withdrawal (as referred to in the Project Operational Manual 

and additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule) shall be 
disbursed in accordance with the DLI Formula, as referred to in the Project 

Operational Manual and additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 of 
this Schedule. 

Without limitation to the provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, if the Budget 
Execution Rule is only partially met, and/or the Bank has received only partial 

evidence of compliance under the DLIs, and/or the Borrower has not presented 

enough Eligible Expenditures under the EEPs to disburse the full planned 

disbursement amounts, the Bank may, at its option, authorize that the 
unwithdrawn portion of the Loan resulting from this lack of evidence be carried 
forward to the subsequent withdrawals, provided that, if this occurs, the amount 

to be disbursed by the Bank, in the aggregate under all subsequent withdrawals, 
shall not exceed 50% of the sum of the total amounts of EEPs referred in the last 

four columns of the table in Schedule 4 to this Agreement for the years up to and 

including the one for which the withdrawal is made. 

The amounts carried forward for subsequent withdrawals shall be disbursed as 

follows: 

(a) the amounts carried forward due to noncompliance with the Budget 

Execution Rule in one or more Project Sectors may be disbursed only if 
at the time of the subsequent withdrawal: 

(i) the Budget Execution Rule has been met for the applicable 

Project Sector(s); and 

(ii) the Borrower has submitted documentation of Eligible 
Expenditures in the amount of at least 2 times the withdrawal 

amount requested; 

-22- 

 



  

(b) the amounts carried forward due to the non-achievement of DLIs may be 

disbursed, only if at the time of the subsequent withdrawal: 

(i) the applicable DLIs have subsequently been achieved; and 

(ii) the Borrower has submitted documentation of Eligible 

Expenditures in the amount of at least 2 times the withdrawal 
amount requested; and 

(c) the amounts carried forward due to lack of documentation of Eligible 

Expenditures in the amount of at least 2 times the amount requested for 
withdrawal, may be disbursed at the time of the subsequent withdrawal 

only if such amount of Eligible Expenditures is then submitted; 

all in accordance with the provisions set forth or referred to in the Project 
Operational Manual and the additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 
of this Schedule. 

If any amount remains to be withdrawn from the Loan Account after the seventh 
application for withdrawal (as referred to in the Project Operational Manual and 

additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule) due to 

partial evidence of compliance with the Budget Execution Rule and/or the DLIs 
and/or lack of documentation of Eligible Expenditures, the Bank may, at its 

option, authorize such remaining amount to be disbursed as an exceptional 

disbursement, prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with the DLI Formula (as 
referred to in the Project Operational Manual and additional instructions referred 

to in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule) and provided the Borrower has submitted 

documentation of Eligible Expenditures in the amount of at least 2 times the 
withdrawal amount requested. 

The Closing Date is November 30, 2017. The Bank may grant an extension of the 

Closing Date only after the Guarantor’s Ministry of Finance has informed the 
Bank that it agrees with such extension.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall 

repay each Disbursed Amount in semiannual installments payable on each April 
15 and October 15, the first installment to be payable on the eleventh (11th) 

Interest Payment Date following the Maturity Fixing Date for the Disbursed 
Amount and the last installment to be payable on the thirtieth (30th) Interest 

Payment Date following the Maturity Fixing Date for the Disbursed Amount. 

Each installment except for the last one shall be equal to one-twentieth (1/20) of 

the Disbursed Amount. The last installment shall be equal to the remaining 

outstanding amount of the Disbursed Amount. 

If any one or more installments of principal of the Disbursed Amount would, 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Schedule, be payable after 

October 15, 2031, the Borrower shall also pay on such date the aggregate amount 
of all such installments. 

The Bank shall notify the Loan Parties of the amortization schedule for each 

Disbursed Amount promptly after the Maturity Fixing Date for the Disbursed 

Amount, 

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs | through 3 of this Schedule, in the 
event of a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of a Disbursed Amount to 

an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that 

is repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 

in each Loan Currency.
