SCHEDULE 2 

Description of the Project 

The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in 
its efforts aimed at poverty alleviation and at providing com- 
pensation to vulnerable groups presently not reached by traditional 
mechanisms in the areas of social assistance, social and socio- 

economic infrastructure and small-scale productive activities. 

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such 
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon 

from time to time to achieve such objectives: 

Part A: Subprojects 

Carrying out of Subprojects. 

Part B: Institutional Support 

1. Improvement of FISE’s operational capacity through provision 

to FISE of: (a) the services of approximately 55 fixed-term 
individual consultants to carry out professional/technical-level 
functions within FISE on a full-time basis and thus operate FISE and 
administer its programs; (b) financing to assist in covering its 
incremental operating costs; (c) vehicles, equipment and office 

furniture; (d) external audit services; and (e) technical assistance 

and training in the areas of institutional development, admini- 
strative and financial management, Subproject development and 
Subproject impact evaluation. 

2. Provision of technical assistance and organization of a 
seminar to assist the Borrower in determining arrangements for the 
closure or possible transformation of FISE in preparation for its 
legally mandated extinction date (December 31, 1997) specified in 
the FISE Decree. 

xk kk 

The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1997.

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works 

Part A: _ Contract Packaging 

To the extent practicable, contracts for Subproject goods 
shall be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent 
of $50,000 or more and contracts for Subproject works shall be 
grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of more 
than $100,000. 

  

Part B: Procurement Procedures 

l. Vehicles and computer equipment under Part B.1l (c) of the 

Project shall be procured under contracts awarded through limited 
international bidding procedures on the basis of evaluation and 
comparison of bids obtained from all qualified suppliers (with 
service facilities in Ecuador) eligible under the “Guidelines for 

Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank 
in May 1992 (the Guidelines) and in accordance with procedures set 

forth in Sections I and II of the Guidelines (excluding paragraphs 
2.8, 2.9, 2.55, 2.56 thereof). For fixed-price contracts, the 

invitation to bid referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines 
shall provide that, when contract award is delayed beyond the 
original bid validity period, the successful bidder’s bid price will 
be increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed correction 
factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign 
currency components and the other to the local currency component of 
the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in 
the bid evaluation. 

2. The following shall be procured under contracts awarded on the 
basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in accordance with 
procedures satisfactory to the Bank: 

(a) Subproject works estimated to cost the equivalent of 

less than $250,000 per contract or per bid package (no Subproject 
works estimated to cost the equivalent of $250,000 or more shall be 
procured under the Project); 

(b) Subproject goods estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$200,000 or less per contract or per bid package (no Subproject

3. The following may be procured under contracts awarded on the 
basis of comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three 
suppliers eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance with 
procedures acceptable to the Bank:

less than $50,000 per contract or per bid package, up to an 

aggregate amount equivalent to $4,300,000; and 

(c) Goods and equipment (including consumable office 

supplies) under Parts B.1 (b) and B.1 (c) of the Project, estimated 
to cost the equivalent of less than $50,000 per contract or per bid

$25,000 per contract or per bid package, up to an aggregate amount 
equivalent to $3,600,000, may be procured under contracts awarded 

after direct negotiations with suppliers, in accordance with 
procedures acceptable to the Bank and only to the extent allowed by 
paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines. Such procedures shall, inter alia, 

require that contract prices be consistent with the standard 
regionalized reference unit prices determined by the Borrower, 
through FISE, pursuant to Section 3.02 (b) of this Agreement. 

5. For procurement in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Part B, 

the Borrower, through FISE, shall use the relevant standard bidding 
documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the 

Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the 
Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been 
issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based 
on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the 
Bank. 

6. For procurement in accordance with paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) of 

this Part B, Subproject Sponsors shall use the standard bidding

documents provided by the Borrower, through FISE, pursuant to 

Section 3.02 (c) of this Agreement. 

Part C: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions 

l. Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final 

contracts: 

(a) With respect to: (i) each contract procured under Part 

B.2 (b) and (c) of Section I of this Schedule estimated to cost more 

than $100,000 equivalent; and (ii) each contract procured under 

Parts B.1 and B.2 (a) of Section I of this Schedule, the procedures 

set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines 
shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of 
the Special Account, such procedures shall be modified to ensure 
that the two conformed copies of the contract required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be 
furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment out 

of the Special Account in respect of such contract. 

(b) With respect to each contract not governed by the 

preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 
of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such 
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, said procedures 
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the 
contract together with the other information required to be 

furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be 
furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished | 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement. 

(c) The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall 
not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals are to be 
made on the basis of statements of expenditure. 

2. The figure of 20% is hereby specified for purposes of 
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines. 

Section II. Employment of Consultants 

1. In order to assist in carrying out the Project and the 
Subprojects, the Borrower, through FISE, shall (and Subproject 
Sponsors may) employ consultants whose qualifications, experience 
and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the 

Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in accordance with 
principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of 

   



  

  

-~ 25 - 

the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers 
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in 

August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines). For complex, time-based 

assignments, such consultants shall be employed under contracts 
using the standard form of contract for consultants’ services issued 
by the Bank, with such modifications as shall have been agreed by 
the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract documents have been 
issued by the Bank, other standard forms agreed with the Bank shall 
be used. 

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, 
the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank 
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, 

letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts 
shall not apply to contracts for consultants (occupying positions 
within FISE at a level lower than that of Department Director) under 
Part B.1 (a) of the Project. However, this exception to prior Bank 
review shall not apply to the terms of reference for such contracts, 
to single source selection of firms or to assignments of a critical 
nature as reasonably determined by the Bank. 

3. No consultant under Part B.1 (a) of the Project shall, at the 

time he or she is carrying out his or her contractual obligations as 
consultant, hold political or civil service office or any other 
position in an Ecuadorian public sector entity or any position in an 
Ecuadorian political party, nor shall such consultant have any right 
(established during or prior to the carrying out of his or her 
consulting services) to re-entry into any such office or position 
upon the conclusion of his or her consulting services. The only 
exception to such re-entry right prohibition shall be if no civil 
service benefits (such as remuneration, seniority rights, pension 

rights, etc.) accrue to the consultant in question at any time with 
respect to the period during which such consultant is carrying out 
such contractual obligations. 

Section III. Special Provisions 

A. In addition and without limitation to any other provisions set 
forth in this Schedule or the Guidelines, the following principles 

of procurement shall expressly govern all procurement of goods 
referred to in Part B.1 of Section I of this Schedule:

each bidder and the total amount of each bid, as well as any 

   



  

  

- 26 - 

alternative proposals, if they have been requested or permitted, 
shall be read aloud when opened.

solvency certified by a foreign bank acceptable to the Borrower 
without recertification by any Ecuadorian bank or other Ecuadorian 
person or entity. 

4. Bid and performance bonds and guarantees issued by foreign 
sureties approved by the Borrower must be admissible without 
recertification or other participation by any Ecuadorian bank or 
other Ecuadorian person or entity. 

5. Letters of credit issued to any supplier of goods or provider 
of services must not be required to be counter-guaranteed by such 
supplier or provider in whole or in part. This shall not prevent 
purchasers from obtaining other performance warranties from 
suppliers. 

B. In addition and without limitation to any other provisions set 
forth in this Schedule or the Guidelines, the following principles 
of procurement shall expressly govern all procurement of goods and 
works referred to in Part B.2 of Section I of this Schedule:

procurement of consultants’ services referred to in Section II of 
this Schedule: 

l. Foreign consultants must not be required to be locally 
registered as a condition of participation in the selection process, 
but may be required to be so registered, at the time of contracting, 
if the Borrower and the Bank so agree. 

2. Foreign consultants must not be required, either 
directly or indirectly, to give any participation in or share of any 
consulting contracts to any local firm or person, except in 
connection with a joint venture arrangement where: (i) a sufficient 
number of capable domestic firms or individual consultants exist to 
allow a foreign consultant reasonable freedom of choice; (ii) the 

contribution of either party to the joint venture arrangement will 
not be constrained by any prescribed manner or extent of 
participation; and (iii) the foreign consultant is not required to 
associate itself with any specific named domestic firms or 
individual consultants. 

3. Foreign consulting firms shall not be required, as a 
condition to provide services in Ecuador under contracts to be 
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, to be registered in 
Ecuador with a minimum capital different from that required for 
Ecuadorian firms. . 

4. Foreign consultants, either individuals or firms, 

providing services under contracts financed out of the proceeds of 
the Loan, shall not be required to pay fees to the Ecuadorian 
Consultants’ Association that are different from those required for 
Ecuadorian consultants. 

Section IV. Internal Approvals 

To the extent any approval of bidding documents or contracts 
(with respect to the procurement of goods, works or services to be 

financed out of the proceeds of the Loan) may be required under the 
laws of the Borrower, such approval need be given only by FISE (and 

by Subproject Sponsors with respect to such documents or contracts 
required for Subproject execution). With regard to the employment of 
consultants, any approval of contracts or of consultant selection 
processes, required under the laws of the Borrower, shall be limited 
to approval by FISE (and by Subproject Sponsors when consultants are 
hired as part of a Subproject).

SCHEDULE 5 

Special Account 

l. For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) the term “eligible Categories" means Categories (1) 

through (5) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to 
this Agreement; 

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in 
respect of the reasonable cost of works, goods and services required 

for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan 
allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance 
with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement, provided, 
however, that notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5 (b) of 
Schedule 7 to this Agreement, payments for expenditures to be 
financed out of the proceeds of free-limit Grants may be made out of 

the Special Account before the Bank shall have authorized with- 
rawals from the Loan Account in respect thereof. Such expenditures, 
however, shall qualify as eligible expenditures only if the Bank 
shall subsequently authorize such withdrawals; and 

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount 

equivalent to $2,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and 
deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this 
Schedule. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively 
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this 
Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that 
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the 
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a 
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan 

Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested. 

   



  

  

~ 29 - 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 
deposits into the Special Account at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, 

the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the 
documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment 
or payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 

withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into 
the Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested and as shall have been 
shown by said documents and other evidence to 
have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures. 

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan 
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the 
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment mace by the Borrower out of the Special 
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall 

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 

expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 
into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all 

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 

Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the 
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement; or 

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated 

to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding 
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal 
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

   



  

  

- 30 - 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories 
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such 
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date 
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure 
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has previded such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 
Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account 

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General 
Conditions.

permitted under paragraphs 6 (a) or 6 (b) of Schedule 7 to the Loan 

Agreement; or (ii) have denied any such applications or requests, 

the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Guarantor, terminate 

the right of the Borrower to submit such applications or approvals 
or to make withdrawals from the Loan Account, as the case may be, 

with respect to such amount or portion of the Loan. Upon the giving 
of such notice, such amount or portion of the Loan shall be 
cancelled.".
