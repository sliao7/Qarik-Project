LOAN AGREEMENT 
 

Agreement dated November 18, 2009, entered into between United Mexican States, 
represented by its signatory on page 6 of this Agreement (“Borrower”) and 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
(“Bank”) for the purpose of providing financing in support of the Program (as defined in 
the Appendix to this Agreement).  The Bank has decided to provide this financing on the 
basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions which the Borrower has already taken under the 
Program and which are described in Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) 
the Borrower’s maintenance of an appropriate macro-economic policy framework.   
 
Whereas the Borrower has informed the Bank that the proceeds of the Loan (as set forth 
in the table in Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement and for purposes of supporting 
the Program), shall be used in conformity with the requirements of the Borrower’s 
income, budgetary and public debt laws and the terms of this Agreement, the Borrower 
and the Bank hereby agree as follows:

amount may be converted from time to time through a Currency Conversion in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this Agreement (“Loan”).

policy framework and its satisfactory implementation of the Program, the 
Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance with Section II 
of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. The Borrower’s Representatives for purposes of 
taking any action required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Section are

shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of 
the General Conditions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of the

in the General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the 
provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion
