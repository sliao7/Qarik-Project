Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,

Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by

multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the

Conversion by either: (a) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the

Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating
to the Conversion; or (b) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
