Agreement dated W k , 1 , 2017, entered into between
REPUBLIC OF SERBIA ("Borrower") and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("Bank") for the purpose of providing
financing in support of the Program (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement). The
Bank has decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions that
the Borrower has already taken under the Program and which are described in Section I of
Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower's maintenance of an adequate
macroeconomic policy framework. The Borrower and the Bank, therefore, hereby agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I - GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS

1.01. The General Conditions (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement) constitute
an integral part of this Agreement.

1.02. Unless the context requires otherwise, the capitalized terms used in this Agreement
have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in the Appendix
to this Agreement.

ARTICLE II - LOAN

2.01. The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, the amount of sixty-six million one hundred
thousand Euros (EUR 66,100,000), as such amount may be converted from time
to time through a Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.08 of this Agreement ("Loan").

2.02. The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program
in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

2.03. The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one half of one
percent (0.50%) of the Loan amount.

2.04. If, at the Borrower's request and on such terms and conditions as the Bank may
agree, the Closing Date is extended, the fee payable by the Borrower for each
extension of the Closing Date shall be at the rate of one quarter of one percent
(0.25%) of the amount of the Loan available for withdrawal upon such extension.
If the Borrower elects to capitalize the fee from the Loan, the Bank shall, on behalf
of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and pay to itself such amounts

required to pay such fee. If the Borrower elects to pay the fee from its own
resources, the Borrower shall pay such fee not later than sixty days after the date
of the notice given by the Bank to the Borrower confirming the extension of the
Closing Date.

2.05. The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate
equal to the Reference Rate for the Loan Currency plus the Variable Spread;
provided, however, that the interest payable shall in no event be less than zero
percent (0%) per annum; and provided furthermore that, upon a Conversion of all
or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the interest payable by the
Borrower during the Conversion Period on such amount shall be determined in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance
remains unpaid when due and such non-payment continues for a period of thirty
days, then the interest payable by the Borrower shall instead be calculated as
provided in Section 3.02 (e) of the General Conditions.

repayment provisions different from those set out in Schedule 2 to this
Agreement for such Withdrawal, provided that: (i) the average maturity of
such Withdrawal does not exceed twenty (20) years from the Withdrawal
Date and the final maturity of such Withdrawal does not exceed thirty-five
(35) years from the Withdrawal Date (or such other average maturity
and/or final maturity as may be generally applicable to loans made by the
Bank to the Borrower at the time of such agreement); and (ii) such
repayment provisions have been agreed between the Borrower and the
Bank prior to the Withdrawal Date of such Withdrawal.

2.08. (a) The Borrower may at any time request any of the following Conversions
of the terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management:
(i) a change of the Loan Currency of all or any portion of the principal
amount of the Loan, withdrawn or unwithdrawn, to an Approved

Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable Rate based on a Variable
Spread to a Variable Rate based on a Fixed Spread; and (iii) the setting of
limits on the Variable Rate or the Reference Rate applicable to all or any
portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding by
the establishment of an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate Collar on the
Variable Rate or the Reference Rate.

accepted by the Bank shall be considered a "Conversion", as defined in
the General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the
provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion
Guidelines.

2.09. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower may, by notice to the Bank,
refund any amount of the Withdrawn Balance for the purpose of re-crediting such
amount to the Loan Account for further withdrawals. Upon such refund, the
repayment schedule shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis, on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.

3.01. The Borrower declares its commitment to the Program and its implementation. To
this end, and further to Section 5.08 of the General Conditions:

SCHEDULE 1

Program Actions; Availability of Loan Proceeds

Section I. Actions under the Proaram

The actions taken by the Borrower under the Program include the following:

Pillar A: Strengthening the Borrower's legal and institutional framework for
post-disaster reconstruction and disaster and climate risk management

1. The Borrower:

(a) established the Public Investment Management Office ("PIMO") (as
evidenced by Government Decree 05 No. 110-12429/2015); and

(b) operationalized PIMO with the mandate to support reconstruction, carry
out the related procurement of goods and services, coordinate the work of
other central, provincial and local governmental institutions and agencies
involved in reconstruction, and coordinate post-disaster damage and needs
assessments (as evidenced by the Borrower's adoption of the Law on
Reconstruction Following Natural and Other Hazards).

Pillar B: Strengthening the Borrower's technical capacity for planning and
implementing disaster and climate risk management activities

2. The Borrower adopted the National Disaster Risk Management Action Plan, which
identifies the activities to be implemented under the National Disaster Risk
Management Program (as evidenced by Government Conclusion 05 No. 217-
1906/2017-1).

Pillar C: Reducing the fiscal impacts, and strengthening the Borrower's
financial capacity to respond to the adverse impacts, of natural hazards,
particularly those exacerbated by climate change

3. The Borrower adopted a disaster risk finance program (as evidenced by
Government Conclusion 05 No. 401-1893/2017), to guide the implementation of
financial protection measures for the purpose of: (a) maintaining fiscal health at
the national level necessary to support long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction
needs; (b) developing sustainable disaster risk financing mechanisms for local self-
governments; and (c) reducing the impact of disasters on the poorest and most
vulnerable population.

Section II. Availability of Loan Proceeds

A. General. The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance
with the provisions of this Section and such additional instructions as the Bank
may specify by notice to the Borrower.

B. Allocation of Loan Amounts. The Loan (except for amounts required to pay the
Front-end Fee) is allocated in a single withdrawal tranche, from which the
Borrower may make withdrawals of the Loan proceeds. The allocation of the
amounts of the Loan to this end is set out in the table below:

Allocations Amount of the Loan
Allocated

(expressed in EURO)
(1) Single Withdrawal Tranche 65,769,500

C. Payment of Fee Pursuant to Section 2.04 of Agreement. If the Closing Date is
extended pursuant to Section 2.04 of this Agreement and the Borrower elects to
finance from its own resources the fee set forth in said Section, no withdrawal shall
be made from the Loan Account until the Bank has received payment in full of
such fee.

D. Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds

1. No withdrawal shall be made of the Single Withdrawal Tranche unless the
Bank is satisfied, based on evidence satisfactory to it, that an emergency
situation exists in the Borrower's territory as a result of a natural disaster
that has been declared by the Borrower, through its central government, in
accordance with the Borrower's relevant legislation, including specifically
the Law on Reconstruction Following Natural and Other Hazards.

2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the receipt by the
Bank of a request for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, the Bank
determines that a review of the Borrower's progress in carrying out the
Program is warranted, the Bank shall give notice to the Borrower to that
effect. Upon the giving of such notice, no withdrawals shall be made of
the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance unless and until the Bank has notified the
Borrower of its satisfaction, after an exchange of views as described in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of said Section 3.01, with the progress achieved by
the Borrower in carrying out the Program.

E. Deposits of Loan Amounts. Except as the Bank may otherwise agree:

1. all withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into
an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank; and

into this account, an equivalent amount is accounted for in the Borrower's
budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank.

F. Excluded Expenditures. The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan
shall not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines at any
time that an amount of the Loan was used to make a payment for an Excluded
Expenditure, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund an
amount equal to the amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to
the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

G. Closing Date. The Closing Date is October 31, 2020.

SCHEDULE 2

Amortization Schedule

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal
Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such
repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

Principal Payment Date Installment Share
(Expressed as a Percentage)

On each June 1 and December 1

Beginning June 1, 2027 5%
through December 1, 2036

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn
Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this
Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as



-10-

withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal
Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each
such amount.
