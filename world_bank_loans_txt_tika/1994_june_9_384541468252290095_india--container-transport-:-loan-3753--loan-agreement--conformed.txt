Procurement 

Section I. Procurement of Geods 

Part A: International Competitive Bidding 

Goods shall be procured under contracts awarded in accordance 
with procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II 
of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines). 

(a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid 

referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, 
when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity 
period, the successful bidder’s bid price will be increased for each 
week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to 
the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign currency components and 
the other to the local currency component of the bid price. Such an 
increase shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. 

(b) In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part 
A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding documents 
issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank 
shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Project. 
Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the 
Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based on other 
internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the Bank. 

(c) To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be 

grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$200,000 or more. 

Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures 
described in Part A. hereof, goods manufactured in India may be 
granted a margin of preference in accordance with, and subject to, 
the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines and 
paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto.

paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. 

2. With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding 
paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of 

Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. 

3. The figure of 152 is hereby specified for purposes of 
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines. 

Section II. Employment of Consultants 

l. To assist the Borrower, as needed, in the carrying out of the 
Project, the Borrower shall employ consultants whose qualifications, 
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be 
satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in 
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank 
on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World 
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published 
by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines). For complex, 
time-based assignments, the Borrower shall employ such consultants 
under contracts using the standard form of contract for consultants’ 
services issued by the Bank, with such modifications as shall have 
been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract 
documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use other 
standard forms agreed with the Bank. 

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, 
the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank 
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, 
letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts, 
shall not apply to (a) contracts for the employment of consulting 
firms estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each or (b) 

contracts for the employment of individuals estimated to cost less 
than $50,000 equivalent each. However, said exceptions to prior Bank 
review shall not apply to (a) the terms of reference for such 
contracts, (b) single-source selection of consulting firms, (c) 

assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined by the 
Bank, (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting 
firms raising the contract value to $100,000 equivalent or above, or
