SCHEDULE 2 

Description of the Project 

The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower’s efforts to: (i) support 
selected municipalities in implementing its new budgeting and financial management 
system; and (ii) complete selected analytic work on policy reforms at the local 
government level.   

 The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives: 

Part A: Implementing Reforms

Assistance in implementing: (i) existing reforms in the local government; and (ii) 
reforms for municipal financial operations and service delivery, including: (a) reforms 
anticipated under the MFM Bill, which contains provisions based on international best 
practices in budgeting, accounting and financial reporting systems and lays down the 
basis for the implementation of municipal finance reform program in three phases; and 
(b) additional reforms such as regulatory reforms, reforms designed to encourage the 
development of a municipal finance market and support to reformed intergovernmental 
fiscal transfer programs, all through the provision of technical advisory services. 

Part B: Design and Implementation of a Municipal Sector Monitoring and Early 
Warning System

Support the SANT in developing an appropriate model for monitoring municipal 
finances and creating linkages in the two identified components, namely: (i) the 
monitoring of municipal budgets and financial statements, in accordance with the budget 
reform program; and (ii) the monitoring of intergovernmental transfers, in association 
with the Borrower’s Vulindlela Information System, and in compliance with the 
Borrower’s Division of Revenue Act, through the provision of technical advisory 
services. 

Part C: Additional Policy Reforms

1. Implementing reform policies to enable municipalities to access both fiscal and 
financial resources, including drafting legislation for the regulation of municipal systems 
and structures, to clearly stipulate the Borrower’s position on: (i) the responsibilities of 
sub-national entities in accessing finance for provision of basic services; (ii) the existing 



- 12 -

policy framework on municipal borrowing; (iii) subsidizing poor households; and (iv) 
allocation of powers and functions, all through provision of technical advisory services. 

2. Supporting the development of municipal capital markets to create incentives and 
provide remedies, which would encourage the municipalities to participate and seek 
access to finance through private markets, including implementing the policy framework 
within which borrowing by municipalities should take place, through provision of 
technical advisory services.  

3. Re-focusing accuracy in targeting intergovernmental grants in order to enable 
municipalities to improve their creditworthiness by: (i) accurately defining municipalities 
which lack adequate resources to meet their expenditure on minimum operations;  (ii) 
identifying fiscal resources currently being expended at local or community level, and 
analyzing the efficiency for utilization of such resources; (iii) analyzing opportunities for 
simplifying and amalgamation of central resources expended at local levels for greater 
efficiency and support to decentralization; (iv) analyzing the need for, potential benefits 
from, and avenues for extending restructuring grants to additional municipalities; and (v) 
examining new intergovernmental fiscal instruments that may be used in promoting the 
national development goals, all through provision of technical advisory services.  

4. Reviewing and reforming policies on regulation of basic service provision to 
ensure efficient delivery and fair pricing of the services provided by the sub-national 
entities, including municipalities, by clearly defining the limits of regulation of critical 
basic services, and to ensure consistent and transparent regulatory arrangements, which 
would provide consumers with regular avenues for public participation, through 
provision of technical advisory services.  

5. Supporting the development of management tools by municipalities to link the 
integrated development plans and multi-year budgets, including review of appropriate 
policy and practice, as well as develop appropriate local guidelines and support to 
implement multi-year budgets linked to integrated development plans within a broader 
strategy to build capacity in the local government sphere, through provision of technical 
advisory services.

The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2005.
