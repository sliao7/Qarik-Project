withdrawn from time to time.

Basic Principles of Regional Fiscal Reform Fund Operation

The  Regional  Fiscal  Reform  Fund  (RFRF)  shall  be  created  as  an  expenditure  line  item  in  the 
Federal  Budget  of  the  Borrower  for  three  years  (2002  to  2004)  to  assist  in  implementing  the 
Program supported by the Bank loan and shall be operated according to the following principles:

The purpose of the RFRF shall be to reward Subjects of the Russian Federation (regions) 

1.
for successful implementation of Regional Reform Programs under the Program.

Grants from the RFRF shall be provided to regions selected on a competitive basis 

2.
according to a methodology and schedule set out by the Borrower and satisfactory to the Bank.

3.
Regional governments shall prepare a Regional Reform Program on the basis of 
guidelines and selection criteria of which they shall be notified not less than six months before 
the application deadline.

4.
Regional governments shall apply in annual groups (cohorts) and up to five regions in 
each cohort (up to a total of 15 under the Program) shall be selected to receive grants from the 
RFRF.

5.

According to the agreed methodology, MOF shall evaluate the conformity of the 

Regional Reform Programs to the announced criteria and success in their implementation (Phases 
1 and 2). Required minimum standards for Regional Reform Programs agreed with the Bank 
shall be observed.

The annual amount of budgeted resources for the RFRF shall be determined by the 

6.
Borrower and approved in the Law on the Federal Budget for each year of the Program. This 
amount shall be consistent with the following principles of RFRF resource allocation:

a.

local currency equivalent of an average of $8 million per selected region.

RFRF resources for each cohort shall be allocated to selected regions on the 

basis of 30 percent of the pool divided equally, 30 percent proportional to regional population 
and 40 percent according to assessment of individual Regional Reform Programs.

c.

RFRF grants to a given region will be made in two equal installments (equal 

dollars in rouble equivalent) over two fiscal years. Grants shall be made twice yearly, not later 
than June 30 and December 31 of each year. Grants shall be awarded to those regions that have 
successfully implemented their Regional Reform Programs and have met the minimum standards.

Once the amount required is determined, the Borrower shall submit a withdrawal 

7.
application to the Bank who shall transfer dollars into the Deposit Account, established at the 
Central Bank of Russia (CBR) for this purpose. The Borrower shall use loan proceeds in the 
Deposit Account either to service sovereign foreign debt or to purchase local currency from the 
CBR at the official exchange rate and this transaction shall be reported to the Bank within three 
days. An equivalent amount of local currency shall be disbursed from the RFRF to the successful 
regions according to procedures established for federal budget execution. Regional governments 
shall report the receipt of such funds to the MOF and the Bank within three days.
