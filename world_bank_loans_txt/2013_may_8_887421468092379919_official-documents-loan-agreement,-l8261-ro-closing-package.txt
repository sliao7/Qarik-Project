The  following table  sets  forth  the Principal  Payment  Dates of the  Loan  and the percentage  of the
total  principal  amount  of the Loan  payable  on each  Principal Payment  Date ("Installment Share").
If the proceeds  of the  Loan  have been  fully  withdrawn  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment Date,  the
principal  amount  of the Loan  repayable  by the Borrower  on each  Principal  Payment Date shall  be
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable
amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this
Schedule,  to which a  Currency Conversion  applies.

If the  proceeds  of the Loan  have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of the  first Principal  Payment  Date,
the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
shall  be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent that any  proceeds  of the Loan  have  been withdrawn  as  of the first Principal
Payment  Date,  the Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in
accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on  each
Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the date  of such  withdrawal  in  amounts  determined
by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the
numerator  of which  is  the original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I
of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")  and  the
denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for
Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be
adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts  referred to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,
to which  a  Currency  Conversion applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the purposes  solely  of calculating  the principal  amounts  payable
on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall  be repayable  on  each
Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment Date  following
the date  of withdrawal.

-12-

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any  time  the
Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued  on  or  after  the
respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer
apply  to any  withdrawals  made  after the adoption of such  billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  I  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved  Currency,  the
amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any Principal  Payment  Date
occurring  during the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such
amount  in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior  to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so
determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate  component  of the
Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions
of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as
to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such amount.
