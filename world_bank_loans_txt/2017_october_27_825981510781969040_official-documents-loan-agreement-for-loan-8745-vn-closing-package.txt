Schedule.

Schedule  for said Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original

are issued on  or after the respective Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall  no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the  adoption  of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment  Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior  to  the  Conversion  by either:  (i)  the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in  more  than  one Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the amount  denominated
in  each Loan  Currency, so  as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
