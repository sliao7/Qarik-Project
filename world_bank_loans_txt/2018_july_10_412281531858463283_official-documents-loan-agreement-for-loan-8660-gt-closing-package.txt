the  basis, inter alia, of:  (i)  the actions  which the Borrower  has already taken  or supported  under the
Program  and  which  are  described  in  Section  I  of  Schedule  I  to  this  Agreement;  and  (ii)  the

to  in  this Agreement,  the  amount  of two  hundred  fifty  million  Dollars  ($250,000,000),  as
such  amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time  through  a  Currency  Conversion  in
accordance  with the  provisions  of Section  2.08  of this Agreement  ("Loan").

2.02.  The  Borrower  may  withdraw  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  in  support  of the  Program  in

SCHEDULE  2

Amortization Schedule

The  following table  sets  forth the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and the  percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have been  fully withdrawn  as of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by 
the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance as  of the  first Principal  Payment Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment
Share for each  Principal Payment  Date,  such repayable  amount to be adjusted,  as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Loan  have  not been  fully withdrawn  as of the first  Principal  Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  shall be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower  shall repay  the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance as
of such  date in  accordance  with paragraph  I  of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling after the  date  of such  withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the
table  in  paragraph  1  of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the  Loan  withdrawn within  two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding
on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date following  the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date following  the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if at any
time the  Bank adopts a  due date billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued on

or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,  shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule  shall apply separately  to the amount  denominated in each  Loan
Currency,  so as to  produce  a separate amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
