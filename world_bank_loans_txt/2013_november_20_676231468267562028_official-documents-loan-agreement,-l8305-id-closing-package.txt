LOAN  NUMBER  8305-ID

Any  amount withdrawn after the  first Principal  Payment  Date shall  be repaid  on each
Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal 
in  amounts
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the
table  in  paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining

to  in paragraph 4 of this  Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  (2)  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of withdrawal
and  shall  be repayable  on each  Principal  Payment Date  commencing  with the second
Principal  Payment Date following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any time
the Bank adopts  a due date billing system under which  invoices  are issued  on or after
the respective  Principal  Payment  Date, the provisions  of such  sub-paragraph  shall no
longer apply to  any withdrawals  made after the adoption  of such billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all  or any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  to  an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date  occurring  during  the Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the Bank  by
multiplying  such  amount 
in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to
the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan
Currency, so as to produce a separate  amortization schedule  for each such amount.
