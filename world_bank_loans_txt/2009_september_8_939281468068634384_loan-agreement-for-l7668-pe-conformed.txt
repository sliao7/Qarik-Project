defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).   
 

INTERNATIONAL  BANK 

WHEREAS: (A) the Bank has decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, 
of:  (a)  the  actions  which  the  Borrower  has  already  taken  under  the  Program  and  which  are 
described in Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower’s maintenance of an 
appropriate macro-economic policy framework; and   
 

WHEREAS: (B) the Borrower may opt to withdraw the equivalent of $20,000,000 on or 
after the Effective Date and keep the remaining $310,000,000 of the Loan as a contingency for 
future withdrawals. 
 

The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 
 
1.01.  The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement)  constitute  an

2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or referred 
to  in  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of  three  hundred  and  thirty  million  Dollars 
(US$330,000,000),  as  such  amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time  through  a 
Currency  Conversion  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section  2.07  of  this 
Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  The  Borrower  may  withdraw  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  in  support  of  the  Program  in 

accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. 

2.03.  The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of one percent 
(0.25%)  of  the  Loan  amount.  The  Borrower  shall  pay  the  Front-end  Fee  not  later  than 
sixty days after the Effective Date. 

 

 

 

2.04.  The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate equal to 
LIBOR  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Variable  Spread;  provided,  that  upon  a 
Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the interest payable 
by  the  Borrower  during  the  Conversion  Period  on  such  amount  shall  be  determined  in 
accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions. 
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains 
unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment  continues  for  a  period  of  thirty  days,  then  the 
interest payable by the Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 
(d) of the General Conditions. 

 
2.05.  The Payment Dates are April 1 and October 1 in each year. 
 
2.06. 

 (a)

2 to this Agreement. 

(b) 

The Borrower may at the time of requesting a Withdrawal also request repayment 
provisions different from those set out in Schedule 2 to this Agreement for such 
Withdrawal, provided that: (i) the average maturity of such Withdrawal does not 
exceed  18  years  from  the  Withdrawal  Date  and  the  final  maturity  of  such 
Withdrawal does not exceed 30 years from the Withdrawal Date (or such other 
average  maturity  and/or  final  maturity  as  may  be  generally  applicable  to  loans 
made by the Bank to the Borrower at the time of such agreement); and (ii) such 
repayment provisions have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank prior 
to the Withdrawal Date of such Withdrawal.  

The Borrower may at any time request any of the following Conversions of the 
terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: (i) a change of 
the  Loan  Currency  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan, 
withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved  Currency;  (ii)  a  change  of  the 
interest rate basis applicable to all or any portion of the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice 
versa; and (iii) the setting of limits on the Variable Rate applicable to all or any 
portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  by  the 
establishment  of  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or  Interest  Rate  Collar  on  the  Variable 
Rate. 

Any  conversion  requested  pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of  this  Section  that  is 
accepted  by  the  Bank  shall  be  considered  a  “Conversion”,  as  defined  in  the 
General  Conditions,  and  shall  be  effected  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion Guidelines.  

2.08.  Without  limitation  upon  the  provisions  of  Section  5.08  of  the  General  Conditions 
(renumbered  as  such  pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of  Section  II  of  the  Appendix  to  this 
Agreement and relating to Cooperation and Consultation), the Borrower shall promptly

provisions  of  this  Section  and  such  additional  instructions  as  the  Bank  may  specify  by 
notice to the Borrower. 

Allocation of Loan Amounts.  The Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the proceeds 
of the Loan from the Loan account in support of the Program in various drawdowns of a 
single tranche, all withdrawals subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph D below.   
The allocation of the amounts of the Loan to this end is set out in the table below:

request for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, in the course of its monitoring referred 

 

-6- 

to  in  Section  3.01  of  this  Agreement,  the  Bank  determines  that  a  review  of  the 
Borrower’s  macroeconomic  policy  framework  or  of  its  progress  in  carrying  out  the 
Program is warranted, the Bank shall give notice to the Borrower to that effect.  Upon the 
giving of such notice, no withdrawals shall be made of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance 
unless and until the Bank has notified the Borrower of its satisfaction, after an exchange 
of views as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of said Section 3.01, with: (1) the progress 
achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program; and (2) the appropriateness of the 
Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework. 

Deposits of Loan Amounts.  Except as the Bank may otherwise agree:   
 
1. 

all  withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  shall  be  deposited  by  the  Bank  into  an 
account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank; and 

 
2.  

the Borrower shall ensure that upon each deposit of an amount of the Loan into 
this  account,  an  equivalent  amount  is  accounted  for  in  the  Borrower’s  budget 
management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. 

Excluded Expenditures. The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall 
not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines at any time that an 
amount  of  the  Loan  was  used  to  make  a  payment  for  an  Excluded  Expenditure,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  an  amount  equal  to  the 
amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request 
shall be cancelled. 

Closing Date.  The Closing Date is September 8, 2012.  The Bank may, by notice to the 
Borrower,  extend  said  Closing  Date  up  to  three  more  years,  provided  that  the  overall 
Program  continues  to  be  implemented  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  the  Bank  and 
macroeconomic policies are adequate.

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies.

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal 
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

 
(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment  Share”)  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion 
applies. 

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 

-8- 

amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and 
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of 
such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved 
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction 
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the 
provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
