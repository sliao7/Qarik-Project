(d) 

once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible
Category,  less  the  amount  of any  outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by  the

payment or the portion thereof not  so eligible  or justified.  Unless
the  Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the  Bank
into  Special  Account  A  shall  be  made  until  the  Borrower  has
provided  such  evidence  or  made  such  deposit  or  refund,  as  the

expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from  the  Bank, refund  to the Bank
such  outstanding  amount.

such outstanding  amount.
