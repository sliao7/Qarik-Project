SCHEDULE  2

Description  of the  Project

The  specific  objectives  of the Project  are:  (i) to  put in  place  a new  approach  in
support of the Borrower's  National System for Agricultural  Technology Development and
Transfer  (including  measures  to build the  institutional  capacity  required  therefor)  which
would  promote  the  development and testing of technical  packages especially  appropriate
for  small  farmers  and  for divulgation  of new  technology;  (ii)  to promote  private  sector
participation  in  agricultural  research,  by  itself or jointly  with  the  public  sector;  (iii)  to
improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  agricultural  research  (including  adjustment  and
validation)  by  introducing  a demand-driven  competitive  selection  process,  as part of the
aforesaid  new  system,  that  would  enable  cofinancing  of  Research  Subprojects  by
universities  and  other  private  and  public  sector  entities;  (iv)  to  support  decentralization
of  agricultural  research  and  extension  activities  through  the  training  of  providers  of
agricultural  extension  services,  and  the  strengthening  of  Regional  Units  and  the
dissemination  of information;  and (v) to revitalize  under-utilized  assets (both physical  and
human) which currently exist within Colombia's research  services  system; all of the above
with the  aim  of reducing  rural  poverty,  increasing rural  employment  and  improving  the
competitiveness  of Colombian  agricultural  producers.

The Project  consists  of the  following  parts,  subject to  such modification  thereof
as  the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  may  agree  upon  from  time  to  time  to  achieve  such
objectives:

Execution  of Approved  Research  Subprojects  consisting in:  (a) strategic  research
activities  directed  toward  national  priority  goals,  the  results of which  may lead  to  future
activities  of applied  research  and,  eventually,  adaptive research;  and  (b) applied  research
activities, the findings  of which have  the potential  for  immediato  application  by farmers,
for such areas as sustainable production  systems, integrated pest ranagement, post harvest
technologies,  fisheries, and environmental problems, and such other areas as the Borrower,
with the  approval  of the Executive  Council,  and  the  Bank may  agree  from  time to time
that  should  be included  in the Operational  Manual.

2. 
Execution  of  Approved  Research  Subprojects  consisting  in  adaptive  research
and/or 
technology  development  activities 
through
demonstration  parcels,  field  days,  training  and  other  mechanisms  as the  Borrower,  with
the  approval  of the  Executive  Council,  and  the Bank  may  agree  from  time  to  time that
should  be  included  in  the  Operational  Manual;  such  adaptive  research  activities  will

such  as 

transfer 

- 22  -

include adjustment and validation,  both to be done with participation  of local farmers  and
of staff of the  relevant UMATA,  of technology generated  at experimental  stations  so that
technology  could  be  tested  under  the  most  representative  ecological  setting  before  the
technological  packages  are  made  available  to providers  of extension  services.

Part  B: 

Institutional  Development

1. 
Establishment,  support  and  operation  of:  (a)  the  Coordinating  Unit,  including

provided  by the UMATAs or the Agriculture  Secretariats  of Departments or the Regional
Units,  through  the  acquisition  by  the  Ministry  and  utilization  for  the  Project  of motor
vehicles  (including  boats).

(a) 

3. 
Setting  up  by  the  Ministry  of:  (i) a  supervision  system  for  all activities
under the Project;  and (ii)  a Project performance  review  report;  and (b) determination  by
the  Ministry,  on  the  basis  of  the  system  under  (a)  (ii)  above,  of whether  a  follow-up
project  would  be justified,  on  the basis  of sample  case  studies.

4. 
Execution  of training programs  for:  (a)  personnel of the Ministry, particularly  of
the Coordinating  Unit, Panel,  Regional  Panels,  Regional Units and relevant  Departments

5. 
Execution  of  an  assistantship  program  that  will  link  academic  studies  with
practical  work  by means  of enabling  students enrolled  in  the  program  to complete  their
graduate  work  requirements  at  accredited  faculties  in  Colombian  universities  while
undertaking  research  and/or technology development  activities in conjunction with specific
Approved  Research  Subprojects  to  be  or being  carried  out under  Part  A of the Project.

Procurement and  Consultants'  Services

Section  I. 

Procurement  of Goods  and  Works

Part A: 

International  Competitive  Bidding

Except  as  provided  in  Part  D  hereof,  goods other  than  vehicles,  laboratory  and
specialized  agricultural  equipment and other goods agreed upon between the Borrower and
the  Bank  for  purposes  of Part  C.1  of this  Section  I, shall  be  procured  under contracts
awarded  in  accordance  with  procedures  consistent with those  set forth  in  Sections  I  and
II  of the  "Guidelines for  Procurement  under IBRD  Loans and IDA  Credits" published  by
the Bank in  May  1992 (the  Guidelines),  and  in accordance  with  the following  additional
procedures.

(a) 

When  contract  award  is  delayed  beyond  the  original  bid validity period,

paragraph  2.59  of the  Guidelines,  by the  minimum  amount of time required  to  complete
the evaluation,  obtain necessary approvals  and clearances  and award the contract. The bid
validity  period  may  be  extended  a  second  time  only  if the  bidding  documents  or  the
request for  extension  shall provide  for appropriate  adjustment  of the bid  price to  reflect
changes  in the  cost  of  inputs  for  the  contract  over  the  period  of extension.  Such  an
increase  in the bid price  shall not be taken  into account in the bid evaluation.  With respect
to  each  contract  made  subject  to  the  Bank's  prior  review  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of Part  F.1  (a) of this Section, the  Bank's prior  approval  will  be required  for:
(i) a first extension of the bid validity period if the period of extension exceeds  sixty (60)
days;  and  (ii) any  subsequent  extension  of the  bid  validity  period.

(b) 

In the procurement  of goods in accordance  with this Part A,  the Borrower
shall  use  the  relevant  standard  bidding  documents  issued  by  the  Bank,  with  such
modifications  thereto  as the  Bank shall  have  agreed  to  be necessary  for  the purposes  of
the Project.  Where  no  relevant standard  bidding documents have been  issued by the Bank,
the  Borrower  shall  use  bidding  documents  based  on  other  internationally  recognized
standard  forms  agreed  with  the  Bank.

in  the table  in paragraph  I of Schedule  I to this Agreement;

(b) 

the  term  "eligible  expenditures"  means  expenditures  in  respect  of the
reasonable  cost of goods  and  services  required  for  the  Project  and  to  be  financed  out of
the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  eligible  Categories  in
accordance  with  the provisions  of Schedule  1 to this Agreement;  and

(c) 

the  term  "Authorized  Allocation"  means  an  amount  equivalent  to
$2,000,000  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the  Special
Account pursuant to paragraph  3 (a)  of this  Schedule, provided,  however,  that unless the
Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited  to  an  amount
equivalent  to  $1,000,000  until  the  aggregate  amount  of  withdrawals  from  the  Loan
Account plus the total amount  of all  outstanding special  commitments  entered into  by the
Bank  pursuant to Section  5.02  of the General  Conditions shall  be  equal  to or exceed  the
equivalent  of $6,000,000.

Payments  out  of  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  exclusively  for  eligible

2. 
expenditures  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this  Schedule.

After  the  Bank has received  evidence  satisfactory  to it  that the  Special  Account
3. 
has  been  duly  opened,  withdrawals  of  the  Authorized  Allocation  and  subsequent
withdrawals  to  replenish the  Special  Account  shall  be made  as follows:

(a) 

For withdrawals  of the Authorized  Allocation,  the Borrower  shall furnish
to the  Bank  a request or  requests  for  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  of an  amount  or
amounts which do  not exceed the aggregate  amount  of the Authorized  Allocation.  On the
basis  of such  request  or  requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf of the  Borrower,  withdraw
from  the  Loan Account and  deposit into the  Special  Account  such amount  or amounts  as
the  Borrower  shall  have  requested.

(b) 

(i) 

For  replenishment,  of the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account

-31-

(ii) 

Prior  to  or at the  time of each  such  request,  the  Borrower  shall
furnish  to the  Bank the  documents  and  other  evidence  required
pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule  for  the  payment  or
payments  in respect of which replenishment  is requested.  On the
basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the
Borrower,  withdraw from  the Loan Account  and deposit into the
Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have
requested  and  as  shall  have  been  shown  by  said  documents  and
other evidence  to have  been paid  out of the Special  Account  for
eligible expenditures.  All such deposits shall be withdrawn  by the
Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under  the  respective  eligible
Categories,  and  in  the  respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall
have been justified  by  said documents  and  other  evidence.

For  each  payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out  of  the  Special  Account,  the
4. 
Borrower  shall,  at  such  time  as  the  Bank  shall  reasonably  request,  furnish  to the  Bank
such documents  and other evidence  showing that such payment was made exclusively for
eligible  expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraph  3 of this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall

5. 
not be  required  to make  further  deposits  into  the  Special  Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals
should be  made by  the Borrower  directly from  the  Loan Account  in  accordance with the
provisions  of Article  V  of the  General  Conditions and  paragraph  (a)  of Section  2.02  of
this Agreement;

(b) 

if the Borrower  shall have failed  to furnish to the Bank, within the period
of time  specified  in  Section  4.01  (b) (ii)  of this  Agreement,  any  of the  audit  reports
required to be fitrnished to the Bank pursuant to said  Section  in respect of the audit of the
records  and  accounts for  the  Special  Account;

(c) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower  of its intention
to  suspend  in  whole  or  in  part  the right  of the Borrower  to  make withdrawals  from  the
Loan  Account  pursuant to the  provisions  of Section  6.02  of the General  Conditions;  or

(d) 

once the  total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan  allocated  to the  eligible
Categories minus the total amount of all  outstanding special  commitments entered  into by
the  Bank pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of the General  Conditions with  respect to  the Project,
shall equal  the  equivalent  of twice the  amount  of the  Authorized  Allocation.

- 32  -

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the Loan  Account  of the remaining unwithdrawn  amount of
the  Loan  allocated  to  the eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such  further  withdrawals shall be made only after
and to the  extent that the  Bank shall have  been  satisfied that all  such amounts  remaining
on  deposit in the  Special  Account as of the  date of such notice will be utilized  in  making
payments  for  eligible  expenditures.

(a) 

6. 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment  out of the
Special  Account:  (i) was  made for an  expenditure  or  in an  amount not eligible  pursuant
to paragraph  2  of this Schedule;  or (ii) was not justified  by the evidence  furnished  to the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional evidence  as the Bank may request;  or (B)  deposit into the  Special Account  (or,
if the Bank shall  so request,  refund  to the  Bank) an  amount  equal  to the amount  of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree,  no further  deposit  by the  Bank  into the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  until  the
Borrower  has provided  such  evidence  or  made  such  deposit or  refund,  as  the  case  may
be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures,  the Borrower  shall, promptly  upon notice from  the Bank, refund  to the Bank
such outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice to  the  Bank, refund  to the Bank  all  or

any portion  of the funds  on  deposit  in the  Special  Account.

(d) 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),  (b) and (c) of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the relevant provisions  of this Agreement,  including  the
General  Conditions.
