Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have been  fully
withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
determined  by  the  Bank by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal
Payment  Date,  such repayable  amount  to be  adjusted, as  necessary,  to deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

If the proceeds  of the  Loan have  not been fully withdrawn  as  of the  first Principal

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay 
the
Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as  of such date  in accordance  with paragraph  I
of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the
amount  of each  such withdrawal  by  a  fraction, the  numerator  of which is
the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the table  in paragraph  1 of this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on or  after  such
