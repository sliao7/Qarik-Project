Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and the
percentage  of the total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn as  of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount  of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of  the  first  Principal
Payment Date; by (b)  the Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment Date,  such
repayable  amount  to be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts referred  to
in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule, to  which a Currency  Conversion  applies.

Payment  Date,  the principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each Principal  Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent  that any proceeds  of the  Loan have been withdrawn as  of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount

-16-

of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to. be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this Schedule,  to  which a  Currency
Conversion applies.

Amounts of the  Loan withdrawn  within two calendar  months prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date, be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and  shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

3. 

(a) 

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to  the Conversion  by either:  (i)  the exchange rate
that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn Loan  Balance  is denominated  in  more than  one Loan Currency,
the provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply  separately to  the  amount  denominated
in each Loan  Currency, so as to produce  a separate amortization  schedule for each
such amount.
