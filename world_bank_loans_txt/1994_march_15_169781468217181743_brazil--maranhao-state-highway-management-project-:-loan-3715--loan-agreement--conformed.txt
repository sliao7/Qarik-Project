consistent  with  those  set  forth  in  Sections  I  and  II  of  the

For fixed-price  contracts, the  invitation  to bid  referred to
1. 
that,  when
in  paragraph  2.13  of 
contract  award is  delayed beyond the  original bid validity period,
the  successful  bidder's  bid  price  will  be  increased  for  each  week  of
delay  by  two  predisclosed  correction  factors  acceptable  to  the  Bank,
one to be applied  to all foreign currency components  and the  other
to the  local  currency component  of  the bid price. Such an increase
shall not be  taken  into account  in bid evaluation.

In  the  procurement  of  goods  and  works  in  accordance  with  this
2. 
Part A,  the Borrower  shall  use relevant  standard bidding documents
issued  by  the  Bank  for  the  use  of  its  borrowers,  with  such
modifications  thereto  as  the  Bank  shall  have  agreed  to  be  necessary
for  the  purposes  of  the  Project.  Where  no  relevant  standard  bidding

the  Guidelines, provided, however, that:

All  bidding  documents  for  the  procurement  of  goods  shall
1.

information  required  to  establish  the  eligibility  of  a  bid  for  such
preference  and  the  following  methods  and  stages  that  will  be
followed in the  evaluation and  comparison of bids.

- 24-

After  evaluation,  responsive  bids  will  be  classified  in  one  of

2. 
the following  two  groups:

(a)  Group A:  bids offering  goods manufactured in  Brazil if
the  bidder  shall  have  established  to  the  satisfaction  of
the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  that  such  goods  contain
components  manufactured  in  Brazil  equal  to  at  least  50%
of  the value of  the  complete goods.

import  taxes  levied  in  connection  with  the  importation,  or  the  sales
and  similar taxes  levied in connection with the sale or  delivery of
the  goods  pursuant  to  the  bids.  Such  lowest  evaluated  bids  shall
then  be  compared  with  each  other,  and  if,  as  a  result  of  this
comparison, a bid  from group A is  the lowest,  it  shall be  selected
for  the  award.

If,  as  a  result  of  the  comparison  under  paragraph  3  above,  the
4. 
lowest evaluated bid  is  a bid  from group  B, all  group B bids  shall
be  further  compared  with  the  lowest  evaluated  bid  from  group  A  after
adding:  (i) to  the evaluated  bid price  of  goods  to  be  imported  in
each group B bid  an  amount  equal  to the  smaller  of:  (A) the amount
of  customs  duties  and  other  import  taxes  which  a  non-exempt  importer
would have  to pay for  the  importation of  the  goods  offered  in such
group B bid;  or  (B) 15%  of the  c.i.f. bid price  of  such goods;  and
(ii)  to  the  evaluated  bid  price  of  goods  supplied  domestically
offered in each group  B bid an amount  equal  to the  smaller  of:  (A)
the  amount  of  customs duties  and  other  import  taxes which would be
levied on the goods  offered in such group B if they originated from
the  same  foreign  country  as  the  bid  included  in  group  B  which  enjoys
the  lowest customs duties  and other import taxes;  or  (B) 15%  of the
as  a  result  of  this
ex-factory  bid  price  of  such  goods. 
comparison,  the  bid  from  group  A  is  the  lowest,  it  shall  be  selected
if  not,  the  lowest  evaluated  bid  from  group  B,  as
for  the  award;
