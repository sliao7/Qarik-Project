The objectives of the Project are: (i) to strengthen EMBRAPA’s and the State 

Research Agencies’ capability to generate and disseminate technology which would 
contribute to sustained
agricultural development in two distinct agro-ecological regions, the Legal Amazon and

research system by
consolidating research planning and monitoring procedures within the various units and 
institutions belonging to the system under the coordination of EMBRAPA.

cooperative agricultural research system;

(iii) training of professional and administrative staff of EMBRAPA and 

Research Agencies; and

(iv)

upgrading EMBRAPA’s central and decentralized libraries.

Project Impact Assessment and Special Studies

Research program monitoring and assessment of the impact and benefits of 

research, through socio-economic and policy studies; an in-depth mid-term review of 
the Project during the third year of Project implementation, the preparation of future 
research programs, and studies on topics to be approved by the Bank. The provision of 

training and equipment and furniture (including periodicals and books) for the 
purposes of carrying out such reports and studies.

The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1994.
