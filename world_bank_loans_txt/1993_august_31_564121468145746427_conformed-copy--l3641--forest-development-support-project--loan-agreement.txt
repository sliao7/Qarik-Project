                        Description of the Project

    The objectives of the Project are: to support the Program of
the Development of Selected Forestry Branches and Protection of
Ecosystems in National Parks for 1993-1997; to assist in the
introduction of economically and environmentally sound
management practices in the Borrower’s forestry sector; to
reduce environmental damage by increasing the vitality and
productivity of the Borrower’s forests; and to improve the
efficiency of forest activities throughout the Borrower’s
territory.

    The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree
upon from time to time to achieve such objectives:

Part A:   Environmental Forest Management

1.  Intensification of silviculture in existing forests:

Pruning (about 38,000 ha), and thinning (about 500,000 ha of
under 20 year old trees, and about 300,000 ha of trees between
20-40 years old) by GDSF.

2.  Restoration of air-pollution damaged forests:

Restoring about 43,000 ha of forests below 800m in the south
and southwest to achieve mixed forest stands using improved
technologies, such as soil preparation, suitable species,
specially prepared seedlings and other methods.

3.  Afforestation:

Afforestation of about 20,000 ha on land owned by the Borrower
with an appropriate mix of conifers and broadleaf species.

4.  Genetic protection conservation and improvement program:

Development of a nation-wide program of seed storage and
extraction and further development of seed orchards.

5.  Ecosystem protection in national parks:

    (a)   Development of comprehensive conservation and land use
management plans for the existing 17 national parks and
possibly 3-4 new parks, which planning will include public
participation and will standardize the policy and institutional
frameworks.

    (b)   Improving infrastructure and management resources, such
as visitor and administrative centers, computerization, buffer
zone protection, communications and public education.

    (c)   Developing and implementing professional development
and training programs.

    (d)   Developing financially sound programs for national
parks operations and improving environmental management of
national parks’ buffer zones.

Part B:   Harvesting, Skidding and Transport Equipment
          Modernization

    Support for companies, entities and persons in the forest
sector in establishing and operating commercial activities by

the provision of modern, efficient, and environmentally sound
harvesting, skidding and transport equipment.

Part C:   Institutional Development

1.  (a)   Development of a strategy for environmentally sound
forest utilization; (b) completion and implementation of a
forest management information system; and (c) strengthening of
the Borrower’s forestry research program.

2.  (a)   Establishing and maintaining an Office of Project
Implementation within the GDSF including a Section for
Privatization of Forestry Services, and (b) strengthening the
Division of Trade and Marketing; including the provision of
vehicles, equipment, technical assistance and training.

3.  Strengthening the financial and forest management
capabilities of GDSF and improving forest worker technical
training by the provision, inter alia, of technical assistance
and training.

have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in such Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6.  (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of a Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
