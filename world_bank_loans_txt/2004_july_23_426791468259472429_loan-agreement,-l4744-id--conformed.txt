the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal

If  the  Bank  determines  at  any  time  that  any  amount  outstanding  in  the 
Special Account will not be required to cover payments for Eligible Expenditures during 
the  six-month  period  following  such  determination,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon 
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
