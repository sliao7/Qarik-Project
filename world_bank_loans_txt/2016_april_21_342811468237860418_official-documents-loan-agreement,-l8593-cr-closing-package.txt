SCHEDULE1

Program Description

The objectives of the Program  are to contribute  to: (i)  improving  the timeliness  and quality

of health  services;  and (ii)  enhancing  the institutional  efficiency  of the  CCSS.

The Program consists of activities  to be  implemented by the Program Implementing  Entity,
which  approved a broad set of initiatives and actions  to strengthen the health insurance - contained
in the  2015-2018  Strategic  Plan and  the Strategic  Agenda for Strengthening  Health  Insurance  -
a
portion  of which  will  be financially  supported  by  the  Loan and  will  allow  for a gradual  change  in
the  Program  Implementing  Entity  in  order to  achieve  sustainable  results  in the  short, medium  and
long term.

The Program focuses  on  three  priority  areas:  (i)  strengthening  the  health  care  model  with
special emphasis  on increasing the impact  of Primary  Health Care  (PHC),  integration of integrated
health  care networks,  and a  more effective  approach  to  prevention,  early  diagnosis,  and  control  of
chronic  non-communicable  diseases  (NCDs);  (ii)  improving  institutional  management;  and  (iii)
optimizing financial  management.

The  Program  consists  of  the  following  activities  to  be  implemented  by  the  Program

Implementing Entity:

Part I:  Strengthening the Health Care Model

Boosting  the  scope  and  capacity  of  PHC  facilities  to  prevent  and  control  NCDs,  and
integrating  health  services  across  different  levels  using  international  best  practices,  allowing  for
comprehensive,  timely  treatment and ensuring continuity  of care in the various  levels of care  of the
health insurance  system, through the following  activities:

(a)  modernizing  and  strengthening  the  PHC  network  nationwide  to  improve  the
quality  of  services,  increase  coverage  of the  population,  and  ensuring  that  the
network  has  greater capacity  for prevention,  early  diagnosis,  and  control  of non-
communicable  diseases (NCDs)  and  other conditions  that are  relevant to the  local,
regional,  and  national epidemiological  profile;  and

(b) 

strengthening  the  integration  of PHC  services  into  the  network  of services  at  all
levels of care,  including:  (i) expanding infrastructure  and equipment  at the first and
second  levels  of care;  (ii)  improving  human  resources  training to  better  attend  to
the needs  of patients;  (iii)  upgrading  equipment;  (iv)  updating clinical  guidelines
and pathways,  with  an  emphasis on  chronic conditions  affecting  a large part of the
population;  and  (v)  implementing  new  mechanisms  for  integrating  PHC  with
second  level  services (hospitals)  using international  best practices.

-6-

Part H:  Improving Institutional Management

Strengthening  institutional  capacity  to  better  manage  the  Program Implementing  Entity

in general,  and  the health  insurance  in particular,  including:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

aligning  central  level  management  to  reduce  the  complexity  of  administrative
processes;

reducing  management  in  silos  through  linking  health  care  decisions  with  their
impact on  administrative  and financial  changes  and  nation-wide  objectives;  and
increasing  the  use  and  impact  of household  data  collected  by  the  PHC  teams  by
digitalizing data and linking  it to existing E-Health tools to  generate  big data pools
for directors  and managers  to enable  them to  better allocate  resources  and  monitor
results.

Part III:  Optimizing  Financial Management

Improving  the  quality  of  financial  data for  the  Program  Implementing  Entity's  Senior
Management  and  Board  of  Directors  to  enable  them  to  closely  monitor  actuarial  analysis  and
income/expenditure  trends,  including:

institutional  capacity 

in 

terms  of  financial  and  budgetary

international  best  management  practices 

to  strengthen 

financial

improving 
management;

the 

adopting 
management;  and

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

optimizing  administrative,  logistical  and  financial  processes  and  procedures

of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date

Principal  Payment  Date,  the principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
(a)
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment
Share for each Principal Payment Date,  such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,

If the proceeds  of the Loan have not  been fully  withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment

Principal  Payment Date, the Borrower  shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance as
of such date in  accordance  with  paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date falling  after  the date  of such  withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the  Bank by  multiplying the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts repayable  to be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding
on  the  second Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall

- 14  -

be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date following  the  date  of withdrawal.

(b). 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the Bank adopts  a due date  billing system under  which invoices are  issued  on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer  apply to any  withdrawals  made after the adoption  of such
billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date occurring during the Conversion  Period,  shall  be determined  by the  Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines, the  exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule  shall apply  separately  to the amount  denominated  in  each Loan
Currency,  so  as to produce a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
