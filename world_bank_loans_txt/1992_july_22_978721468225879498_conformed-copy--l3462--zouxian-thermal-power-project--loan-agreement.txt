(b)

the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 

reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule l to this Agreement; and

(c)

the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to 

$15,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the Special Account 
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.

Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of the Special Account 

2.
shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions 
of this Schedule.

After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 

3.
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account may be made as follows:

(a)

On the basis of a request or requests by the Borrower for a deposit or 
deposits which add up to the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation, the Bank 
shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such 
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b)

The Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for replenishment of the 

Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall specify. On the basis of such 
requests, the Bank shall
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amounts as 
shall be required to replenish the Special Account with amounts not exceeding the 
amount of payments made out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures. All such 
deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective 
eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been 
justified by the evidence supporting the request for such deposit furnished pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule.

For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account for which the 

4.
Borrower requests replenishment pursuant to paragraph 3 (b) of this Schedule, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to or at the time of such request, such 
documents and other evidence as the Bank shall reasonably request, showing that such 

payment was made for eligible expenditures.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 

amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures

such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice 
will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

(a)

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 

6.
Special Account (i) was made for any expenditure or in any amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule, or (ii) was not justified by the evidence 
furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall, promptly upon 
notice from the Bank, deposit into the Special Account
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. No further 
deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has made 
such deposit or refund.

(b)

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 

in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount for crediting to the Loan Account.

(c)

The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 

portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
