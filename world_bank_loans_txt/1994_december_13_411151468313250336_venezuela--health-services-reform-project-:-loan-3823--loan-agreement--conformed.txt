to  the  Bank  a  request  or  requests  for  a  deposit  or  deposits  which  do  not  exceed  the
aggregate  amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of such request or requests,
the Bank shall,  on behalf of the Borrower,  withdraw  from  the Loan  Account  and  deposit
in the  Special  Account  such amount  or  amounts  as the  Borrower  shall  have  requested.

(b) 

(i) 

For  replenishment  of the  Special  Account,  the Borrower  shall
furnish  to  the  Bank  requests  for  deposits  into  the  Special

Prior to or  at the time of each such request,  the Borrower  shall
furnish to the  Bank the documents  and other evidence  required
pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule  for  the  payment  or
payments  in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the
basis  of each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the
Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have
requested  and as  shall  have been shown  by  said documents  and
other evidence  to have  been paid  out of the Special Account for
eligible expenditures.

All  such deposits  shall  be withdrawn  by the Bank from  the Loan  Account  under
the respective eligible  Categories,  and in the respective  equivalent  amounts, as  shall have
been justified by  said  documents  and  other evidence.

For  each  payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out  of  the  Special  Account,  the
Borrower  shall,  at  such time  as the  Bank  shall  reasonably  request,  furnish  to  the Bank
such documents  and  other evidence  showing that such payment was  made exclusively for
eligible  expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraph  3 of this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall

5. 
not be  required  to  make further  deposits  into the  Special  Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals
should  be  made by  the Borrower  directly  from the Loan Account  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of Article  V  of the  General  Conditions  and paragraph  (a) of Section  2.02  of'
this Agreement;  or

(b) 

once  the total  unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan  allocated  to the  eligible
Categories,  less  the amount  of any  outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by  the
Bank pursuant to Section  5.02  of the General  Conditions with respect to the Project,  shall
equal  the equivalent  of twice the amount  of the  Authorized  Allocation.

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of the  remaining  unwithdrawn
amount  of the  Loan allocated  to the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as
the Bank shall specify by  notice to the Borrower.  Such further  withdrawals  shall be made
only  after and to the extent  that the Bank  shall have been  satisfied that  all  such  amounts
remaining  on deposit in the Special  Account as of the date of such  notice will  be  utilized
in  making  payments  for  eligible expenditures.

(a) 

6. 
If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any payment out of the
Special Account:  (i) was  made  for an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not eligible  pursuant
to paragraph  2  of this Schedule;  or (ii)  was not justified  by the evidence  furnished  to the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional evidence as the Bank may request;  or (B)  deposit into  the Special  Account (or,
if the  Bank  shall so  request,  refund to  the Bank) an  amount  equal to  the amount  of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the  Bank  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be made  until  the
Borrower  has provided  such  evidence  or made  such deposit  or  refund,  as  the  case  may
be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly  upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank
such outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank all  or

any portion  of the funds  on  deposit in the  Special  Account.

(d) 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs  6 (a),  (b) and (c) of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in accordance  with  the relevant  provisions  of this Agreement,  including the
General  Conditions.
