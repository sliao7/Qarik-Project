Loan and the percentage of the total principal amount of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan 
payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Non 
Concessional Portion of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, 
the principal  amount of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by the  Bank by multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn 
Balance of the Non-Concessional Portion of the  Loan as  of the first  Principal  Payment Date; by 
(b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, 
as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies.

To the  extent that any proceeds of the Non-Concessional  Portion of the Loan have been 
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn 
Balance of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan as  of such date in accordance with 
paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be repaid  on  each 
Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by 
the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator 
of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1 of this 
Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")  and  the 
denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal 
Payment  Dates  falling  on or after such date,  such amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted,  as 
necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4  of this  Schedule, to which a 
Currency Conversion applies. 

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Non-Concessional  Portion  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar 
months  prior to any Principal  Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating 
the principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal  Payment Date following  the date of withdrawal and 
shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal 
Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

-15-

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph ( a)  of this  paragraph, if at any time the 
Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued  on  or after  the 
respective Principal  Payment Date,  the  provisions  of such sub-paragraph shall no  longer 
apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Balance of the Non-Concessional Portion of the 
Loan  to  an  Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is 
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately 
prior to the Conversion by either: (a) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the 
Approved  Currency payable by the Bank under the  Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion;  or (b)  if the  Bank so determines in accordance with the  Conversion Guidelines,  the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Balance of the Non-Concessional  Portion of the  Loan is  denominated in more 
than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount 
denominated in each Loan Currency,  so as  to  produce a separate amortization schedule  for each 
such amount.
