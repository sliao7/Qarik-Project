ARTICLE  II - LOAN

The Bank  agrees  to lend  to the  Borrower,  on the terms  and  conditions  set  forth  or
referred  to  in  this  Agreement,  the amount  of seven  million  Dollars  ($7,000,000),
as  such  amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time  through  a  Currency
Conversion  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Section  2.08  of this  Agreement
("Loan").

2.02. 

The Borrower  may  withdraw  the proceeds  of the  Loan  in  support  of the  Program
in  accordance  with  Section  II of Schedule  I to  this Agreement.

2.03. 

The  Front-end  Fee  payable  by  the  Borrower  shall  be  equal  to  one  half  of one
percent (0.50%),  of the  Loan  amount.

2.04. 

If,  at  the  Borrower's  request  and  on  such  terms  and  conditions  as  the  Bank  may
agree,  the  Closing  Date  is  extended,  the  fee  payable  by  the  Borrower  for  each
extension  of the  Closing  Date  shall  be  at  the  rate  of one  quarter  of  one  percent
(0.25%)  of the  amount  of the Loan  available  for withdrawal  upon  such extension.
If  the  Borrower  elects  to  capitalize  the  fee  from  the  Loan,  the  Bank  shall,  on
behalf  of the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to  itself such
amounts  required  to  pay  such  fee.  If the  Borrower  elects  to  pay  the  fee  from  its
own  resources,  the  Borrower  shall  pay  such  fee  not  later than sixty  days after the

equal  to  the  Reference  Rate  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Fixed  Spread;
provided,  that  upon  a  Conversion  of all  or  any portion  of the principal  amount  of
the  Loan,  the  interest  payable  by  the  Borrower  during  the  Conversion  Period  on
such  amount  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of
Article  IV  of the  General  Conditions.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any
amount  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains  unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-
payment  continues  for  a  period  of thirty  days,  then  the  interest  payable  by  the
Borrower  shall  instead  be  calculated  as  provided  in  Section  3.02(e)  of  the
General  Conditions.

2.06. 

The Payment  Dates  are  February  15  and  August  15  in  each year.

of such  Withdrawal  does  not exceed  18  years  from  the Withdrawal  Date

outstanding  by  the  establishment  of an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or  Interest  Rate
Collar on the  Variable  Rate  or the  Reference  Rate.

(b)

The  Borrower  has  established  a  historic  loss  and  damage  database  in
collaboration  with  the  United  Nations  International  Strategy  for  Disaster

Bank.
