otherwise  agree,  the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited  to  an  amount  equivalent  to
$1,000,000  until  the  aggregate  amount  of withdrawals  (from  the  Loan  Account  plus  the
total  amount  of all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to
Section  5.02  of  the  General  Conditions)  shall  be  equal  to  or  exceed  the  equivalent  of

the  Special  Account  such  amount  or amounts  as the  Bank  shall have  determined to  be  so
required.

(b)

5. 
be required  to make further deposits  into the  Special Account:

provisions of Article  V of the General Conditions  and paragraph (a) of Section  2.02 of this
Agreement;

(b) 

if the Borrower shall  have  failed to furnish  to the Bank, within  the  period

if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention to
suspend  in  whole  or in part the right of the Borrower to  make withdrawals  from the Loan
Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

(d)

Categories,  minus the total  amount of all outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by

-31  -

the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General  Conditions  with  respect  to  the  Project,
shall equal the equivalent  of twice the amount of-the Authorized  Allocation.
Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of
the  Loan  allocated to  the  eligible Categories  shall follow  such procedures  as the  Bank  shall
specify  by notice to the  Borrower. Such further withdrawals  shall  be made only  after and to
the extent that the  Bank shall have been satisfied that all such  amounts  remaining on deposit
in the Special  Account  as  of the date  of such notice  will  be  utilized  in making  payments  for
eligible  expenditures.

(a) 

6.

Special  Account:  (i)  was made  for an  expenditure  or in  an  amount  not  eligible  pursuant to
paragraph 2  of this Schedule;  or (ii)  was  not justified by the evidence  furnished to the  Bank,
the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such  additional
evidence  as the Bank  may  request;  or (B)  deposit  into the  Special  Account  (or,  if the Bank
shall so  request, refund  to the  Bank) an amount equal  to the amount  of such  payment  or the
portion  thereof not so eligible  or justified. Unless  the Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  no further
deposit  by the  Bank into the  Special  Account shall be  made until  the Borrower has  provided
such evidence  or made  such deposit or refund, as  the case may be.

(b) 

If the  Bank  shall have  determined  at  any time that any  amount outstanding
