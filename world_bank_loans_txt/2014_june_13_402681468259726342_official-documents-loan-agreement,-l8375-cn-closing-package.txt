Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall, for the purposes solely  of calculating  the principal

paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of

Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved.
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment  Date  occurring during  the Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the  Bank by  multiplying such  amount  in  its currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to the  Conversion by  either:  (i) the  exchange  rate that reflects the  amounts of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the
Conversion Guidelines,  the exchange  rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization  schedule  for each such amount.
