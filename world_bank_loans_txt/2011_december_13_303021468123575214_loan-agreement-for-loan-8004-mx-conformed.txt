STATES  (“Borrower”),  represented  by  its  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Public  Credit 
(Secretaría  de  Hacienda  y  Crédito  Público  -  SHCP),  and  INTERNATIONAL  BANK 
FOR  RECONSTRUCTION  AND  DEVELOPMENT  (“Bank”)  for  the  purpose  of 
providing  financing  in  support  of  the  Program  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this 
Agreement).  The Bank has decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of 
(a) the actions which the Borrower has already taken under the Program and which are 
described  in  Section  I  of  Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement,  and  (b)  the  Borrower’s 
maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework.   
 

Whereas the Borrower has informed the Bank that the proceeds of the Loan (as 
set forth in the table in Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement, and for purposes of 
supporting  the  Program),  shall  be  used  in  conformity  with  the  requirements  of  the 
Borrower’s income, budgetary and public debt laws and the terms of this Agreement, the 
Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as follows:

referred  to  in  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of  seven  hundred  fifty  one  million 
eight  hundred  seventy  nine  thousand  seven  hundred Dollars  ($751,879,700.00), 
as  such  amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time  through  a  Currency 
Conversion in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this Agreement 
(“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  As a consequence of the Borrower’s maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic 
policy  framework  and  its  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Program,  the 
Borrower may withdraw, or may cause BANSEFI to withdraw, the proceeds of 
the Loan in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. Unless

Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any 
amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-
payment  continues  for  a  period  of  thirty  days,  then  the  interest  payable  by  the 
Borrower  shall  instead  be  calculated  as  provided  in  Section  3.02  (e)  of  the
