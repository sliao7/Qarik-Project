(i) 

Eligibility  to  participate  in  a procurement  process  and  to be  awarded  a  Bank-
financed  contract  shall  be  as  defined  under  Section  I  of  the  Procurement
Guidelines;  accordingly,  no  bidder  or  potential  bidder  shall  be  declared

the  Procurement  Guidelines.  No  restriction  based  on  nationality  of bidders
and/or  origin  of goods  shall  apply,  and  foreign  bidders  shall  be  allowed  to
participate in NCB  without  application of restrictive  conditions.

(ii) 

All  invitations  to prequalify  or bid shall  be advertised  in  a national  newspaper
of wide  circulation  in the  Borrower's  country,  or on  a  widely  used website  /
electronic  portal  with  free  national  and  international  access  acceptable  to  the
Bank except for goods or non-consulting services contracts  that are estimated to
cost less than $300,000  equivalent  each, or works  contracts that are estimated to
cost  less than  $2,000,000  each,  which  may  be advertised  in  a provincial  daily
newspaper.  Such advertisement  shall be made in sufficient time for prospective

-10-

bidders to  obtain prequalification  or bidding documents  and prepare  and submit
their responses.  In any event,  a  minimum of thirty  (30)  days  shall  be given  to
bidders  between  the  date  of such  advertisement  (or  the  date  of availability  of
bidding  documents,  whichever  is later)  and the deadline  for  the  submission  of
bids,  and  the advertisement  and  bidding documents  shall  specify  the deadline
for  the  submission  of bids.  In  the  case of such  advertisement  on  a  website  /
electronic  portal,  the  notice  shall  remain  readily  accessible  nationally  and
internationally  until  at  least the deadline  for the  submission  of bids.  Potential
bidders  shall be allowed to  inspect and purchase bidding documents  at any time

Prequalification procedures  and documents acceptable to the Bank shall be used

upon which a bidder was prequalified,  including  current commitments,  shall. be
carried out at the time of contract award, along with the bidder's capability  with
respect  to  personnel  and  equipment.  All  bidders  that  meet  the  qualification
criteria  set  out  in the pre-qualification  documents  shall  be  allowed to  bid,  and
there  shall  be  no  limit  on  the  number  of pre-qualified  bidders.  Where  pre-
qualification is not used, the qualification  of the bidder who is recommended  for
award  of  contract  shall  be  assessed  by  post-qualification,  applying  the
qualification  criteria stated in the bidding documents.

Registration  shall not be used to  assess bidders'  qualifications.  A bidder  shall
not  be  required  to register as  a  condition  for  inspecting  or purchasing  bidding
documents,  submitting its bid or receiving contract award.  A bidder determined
to  be  the  lowest  evaluated  responsive  bidder,  shall  be  given  reasonable
opportunity  of registering  (if  required)  before  contract  signing  without  any  let
or  hindrance.  Bidding  shall  not  be  restricted  to  any  particular  class  of
contractors,  and non-classified  contractors  shall  also be  eligible to bid.

(vii) 

No  margins  of preference  of any  sort  shall  be given  to  bidders,  such as  on the
basis  of their  location,  place of incorporation,  or affinity  with the geographical
area in which the Project activities  will take place.

(viii)  All  bidders  who  are  awarded  contracts  for  works  and  single-responsibility

(ix) 

Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids by  mail or in person.

-ll-

(x) 

(xi) 

(xii) 

(xiii) 

(xiv) 

(xv) 

All  bids  shall be opened  in public; all bidders  shall be offered  an opportunity  to
be present  (either  in person or through  their representatives)  at  the time  of bid
opening,  but  bidders  shall not be required  to  be present at  the bid opening.

All  bid  evaluation  criteria  shall  be  disclosed  in  the  bidding  documents  and
quantified  in monetary terms  or expressed  in  the form  of pass/fail  requirements.

No  bid  may  be  rejected  solely  on  the  basis  that  the  bid  price exceeds  any  cost
estimate  or  falls  outside  any  margin  or  bracket  of prices  or  average  bids
established  by the Borrower or  the Project Implementing  Entity / Entities, as  the
case  may  be.  Rejection  of all  bids  or  re-bidding  shall  not  be  allowed  solely
because  the  number  of bids  is  less  than  three  (3),  and  rejection  of all  bids  or
rebidding  shall not take  place without the Bank's prior written agreement.

Each contract  shall  be awarded  to  the lowest  evaluated  responsive  bidder,  that
is,  the  bidder who  meets  the appropriate  standards  of capability  and resources
and whose  bid  has been  determined:  (A)  to  be  substantially responsive  to  the
bidding  documents;  and  (B)  to  offer the  lowest  evaluated  cost.  The  winning
bidder  shall  not  be  required,  as  a  condition  of  award,  to  undertake
responsibilities  for work  or to  assume  other  obligations  not  stipulated  in  the

of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment Share").  If the proceeds of the Loan  have been fully withdrawn as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  principal  amount of the Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan Balance as  of the first Principal  Payment Date;  by (b) the Installment
Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to deduct  any amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency

To  the extent  that  any proceeds  of the Loan  have been withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance as
of such date in accordance with  paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be repaid on
each Principal  Payment Date falling after the date  of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the Bank  by  multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal  by a
fraction, the numerator  of which  is the original  Installment  Share specified  in the
table  in paragraph  I  of this Schedule  for said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment Dates  falling on or after  such
date, such amounts  repayable to be adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

Amounts  of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date shall,  for  the purposes  solely  of calculating  the principal  amounts
payable on any Principal  Payment Date, be  treated  as withdrawn  and outstanding
on the second  Principal  Payment  Date  following the date  of withdrawal  and shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment Date following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the  Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices  are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after the adoption of such
billing  system.

4. 

S. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance  to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date  occurring during  the Conversion Period, shall  be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the exchange  rate that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in the
Approved  Currency  payable by  the Bank under  the Currency  Hedge Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if  the Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange rate  component of the Screen  Rate.

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule  shall apply separately  to the amount denominated  in each Loan
Currency, so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each  such amount.
