Description of the Project

The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower to: (a) expand 

availability of electricity to rural customers in Indonesia who cannot be served 
economically or in a timely manner
by conventional rural electrification; (b) facilitate participation by the private 
sector in advancing renewable energy commercialization; (c) promote environmentally 
sound energy resource
development and reduce the dependence of the Borrower’s energy sector on fossil fuels; 
(d) bring about cost effective mitigation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; and (e) 
strengthen the Borrower’s institutional capacity to support and sustain decentralized 
rural electrification.

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 

thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives:

Part A:

Provision of Subloans and Subgrants to finance Subprojects consisting of the 

sale and installation in the Project Area of an aggregate of about 200,000 Solar Home 
Systems by Dealers.

Technical Assistance

Part B:
 
1.
provision of consultants’ services in connection with:

Strengthening the Borrower’s capacity for Project implementation through 

(a)

the evaluation and monitoring of Dealer compliance with the terms and 

conditions of Subloans and the GEF Grant;

(b)

assessment of business plans and Subproject applications submitted by 

Dealers;

(d)
customers.

(c)

establishment of contacts with and assessing the capacity of prospective 

maintenance of contacts with actual and prospective Solar Home System 

 

(b)

(c)

2.
strategy for the utilization of appropriate solar photovoltaic technology, through:

Strengthening the Borrower’s capacity to design and implement a long-term 

(a)

the conduct of a decentralized rural electrification study to complement 

Borrower’s existing least-cost grid-based rural electrification plan;

the development of the Solar Home Systems Action Plan; and

provision of training and study tours in photovoltaic utilization for 

selected officials of the Borrower, including, without limitation, relevant officials 
of BPPT, DGEED and BAPPENAS, and for selected officials of private sector 
organizations involved in implementation of decentralized rural electrification by 
Solar Home Systems.

3.
Strengthening BPPT’s capability to technically certify Solar Home Systems and to 
monitor systems in the field, through the provision of training to selected BPPT staff 
in the use of appropriate testing equipment and techniques.
