Bidding  documents  shall  be  sold  to  anyone  who  is  willing  to  pay  the
required  fee  for  the  bidding  documents  which  shall  not  exceed  the  costs

the total  cost at destination  including all  taxes  and  duties.

No  bid shall  be rejected  on the  basis  of a comparison  with the  employer's
estimate  and  budget  ceiling  without  the  World  Bank's  prior  written
agreement.

Rejection  of All  Bids and Re-biddiing

Rejection  of all  bids  is justified when  there is  lack  of effective  competition,  or all

criteria,  or  the  bid  price  of the  lowest  evaluated  winning  bid  is  substantially  higher than

be  determined  solely on the  basis  of the  number  of bidders.  Even  when  only  one  (1) bid
is  submitted,  the  bidding  process  may  be  considered  valid  if the  bid  was  satisfactorily
advertised,  the  qualification  criteria were  not unduly  restrictive, and  prices  are reasonable
in  comparison  to  market  values.  All  bids  shall  not  be  rejected  or  new  bids  solicited

procedures,  including  by  publicly  declaring  such  firm  or  individual  ineligible,  either
indefinitely  or  for  a  stated  period  of  time:  (i)  to  be  awarded  a  World  Bank-financed

Procurement  Guidelines  constitute  an  obstructive  practice  as  defined  in  the  Procurement
Guidelines.
