shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Annex A to this Schedule 1; and

A.5  of  this  Schedule  1  adequately  provide  the  information  required  for  Report-based 
Disbursements; 

- 18 -

(b) 

if  the  Bank  determines  at  any  time  that  all  further  withdrawals  for 
payment  of  Eligible  Expenditures  should  be  made  by  the  Borrower  directly  from  the 
Loan Account; or 

(c) 

 
if the Bank shall not have received, within the period of time specified in

the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of: (i) the records and accounts 
for  the  Special  Account;  or  (ii)  the  records  and  accounts  reflecting  expenditures  with 
respect  to  which  withdrawals  were  Report-based  Disbursements  or  were  made  on  the 
basis of statements of expenditure, as the case may be. 

5. 
The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account 
in accordance with the provisions of Part B.2 of this Schedule if, at any time, the Bank 
shall have notified the Borrower and the Guarantor of its intention to suspend in whole or 
in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to 
Section  6.02  of  the  General  Conditions.    Upon  such  notification,  the  Bank  shall 
determine, in its sole discretion, whether further deposits into the Special Account may 
be  made  and  what  procedures  should  be  followed  for  making  such  deposits,  and  shall 
notify the Borrower and the Guarantor of its determination. 

(a) 

If the Bank determines at any time that any payment out of the Special 
6. 
Account was made for an expenditure which is not an Eligible Expenditure, or was not 
justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice 
from the Bank, provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request, or deposit into 
the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal 
to the amount of such payment.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit 
by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) 

 
If  the  Bank  determines  at  any  time  that  any  amount  outstanding  in  the 
Special Account will not be required to cover payments for Eligible Expenditures during 
the  six-month  period  following  such  determination,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon 
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

(d)

paragraph  6  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement.

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish

amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of 
each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan 
Account and  deposit into  the  Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall have 
requested. 

(b) 

For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to 
 
the Bank requests for deposit into the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall 
specify.    Prior to  or at the  time  of  each  such  request,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the 
Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant to Part B.3 of Schedule 1 to 
this  Agreement  for  the  payment  or  payments  in  respect  of  which  replenishment  is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as 
the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures. 
Each  such  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  withdrawn  by  the  Bank  from  the 
Loan Account under one or more of the Eligible Categories. 

The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account,

once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan minus the total amount of all outstanding 
special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General 
Conditions  shall  equal  the  equivalent  of  twice  the  amount  of  the  Authorized  Allocation. 
Thereafter,  withdrawal from  the  Loan  Account  of the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of 
the Loan shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have 
been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the 
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan minus the total amount of all outstanding 
special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General 
Conditions shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the  Loan  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank  shall  specify  by  notice  to  the 
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the

Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  Eligible 
Expenditures.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. 
The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  
(a)  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  as  of  the  first 
Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such 
repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2.  
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the  Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

 
To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of  the first  Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  amount  withdrawn  and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) 

 
Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, 
the  numerator  of  which  shall  be  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in 
paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original  Installment 
Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such repayment amounts 
to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(a) 

Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
3. 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on 

- 24 -

any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following 
the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if 
 
at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such subparagraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall be 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  said  Conversion  by  either:  (a)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the 
amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (b)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in 
accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate  component  of  the  Screen 
Rate.  

5. 
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall 
apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a 
separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
