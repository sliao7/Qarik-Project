withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) 

 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the  Bank  a request  or requests  for  deposit  into  the  Special  Account of an amount  or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On the

Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have

eligible expenditures. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions of paragraph  3  of  this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall 

5. 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account: 

(a) 

 
if,  at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  that  all  further

accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) 
of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; 

(b) 

if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period 
 
of  time  specified  in  Section  4.01(b)(ii)  of  this  Agreement,  any  of  the  audit  reports 
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the 
records and accounts for the Special Account;

to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the 
Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by 
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of 
twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank

- 22 -

remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized 
in making payments for eligible expenditures. 

(a) 

6. 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph  2  of  this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was  not  justified  by  the  evidence  furnished  to  the 
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, 
if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such 
payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made 
until  the  Borrower  has  provided  such  evidence  or  made  such  deposit  or  refund,  as  the 
case may be. 

(b) 

 
If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  amount 
outstanding  in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 
the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) 

 
any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or 

(d) 

 
Refunds  to  the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of 
this  Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the 
General Conditions.
