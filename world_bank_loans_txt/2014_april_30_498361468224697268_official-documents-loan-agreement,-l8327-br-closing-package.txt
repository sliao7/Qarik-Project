withdrawn  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be

(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal

(a)  To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the
first Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan
Balance  as of such date in  accordance  with paragraph  I of this Schedule.

(b)  Any amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment Date  shall be  repaid
on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date of such withdrawal  in
amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such
withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which is  the  original  Installment
Share  specified  in the  table  in paragraph  1 of this Schedule  for  said Principal
Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which
is the  sum of all remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment

(a)  Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following
the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment
Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the
date of withdrawal.

(b)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at
any  time  the Bank  adopts  a  due  date billing  system under which invoices  are
issued  on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of
such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after the
adoption  of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its
currency  of denomination  immediately  prior to  the  Conversion  by either:  (i) the
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the
Conversion;  or (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate component  of the  Screen Rate.

5. 

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more  than one Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to  the amount  denominated
in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for
each such amount.
