notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  not  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original 
Installment  Share)  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 
 
3. 
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal. 

(a) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if  at  any  time  the  Bank  shall adopt  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which invoices  are 
issued  on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of  such 
billing system.  
 
4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period, 
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate. 
 
5. 
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall  be  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule 

- 25 -

shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
