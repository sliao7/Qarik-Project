by  an  agreement  (the  Guarantee  Agreement)  of  even  date  herewith 
between  the  Guarantor  and  the  Bank,  the  Guarantor  has  agreed  to  guarantee  the

Agreement: 

 
(a) 
 

 Section 6.03 is modified to read: 

“Section 6.03.  Cancellation by the Bank.  If (a) the right of the 
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account shall have been 
suspended  with  respect  to  any  amount  of  the  Loan  for  a  continuous 
period  of  thirty  days,  or  (b)  at  any  time,  the  Bank  determines,  after 
consultation with the Borrower, that an amount of the Loan will not be 
required to finance the Project’s costs to be financed out of the proceeds 
of the Loan, or (c) at any time, the Bank determines, with respect to any 
contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, that corrupt or 
fraudulent practices were engaged in by representatives of the Borrower

of  such  contract,  without  the  Borrower  having  taken  timely  and 

- 2 -

appropriate  action  satisfactory  to  the  Bank  to  remedy  the  situation, and 
establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of such contract which 
would otherwise have been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of 
the Loan, or (d) at any time, the Bank determines that the procurement of 
any  contract  to  be  financed  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  is 
inconsistent  with  the  procedures  set  forth  or  referred  to  in  the  Loan 
Agreement and establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of such 
contract  which  would  otherwise  have  been  eligible for  financing  out  of 
the proceeds of the Loan, or (e) after the Closing Date, an amount of the 
Loan shall remain unwithdrawn from the Loan Account, or (f) the Bank 
shall  have  received  notice  from  the  Guarantor  pursuant  to  Section  6.07 
with respect  to  an  amount of  the  Loan,  the  Bank  may,  by  notice to  the 
Borrower and the Guarantor, terminate the right of the Borrower to make 
withdrawals  with  respect  to  such  amount.  Upon  the  giving  of  such 
notice, such amount of the Loan shall be cancelled.”

the General Conditions have the respective meanings therein set forth and the following
