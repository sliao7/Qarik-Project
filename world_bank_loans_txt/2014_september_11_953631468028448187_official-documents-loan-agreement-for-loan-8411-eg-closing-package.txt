withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any

on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to  the Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the exchange  rate  that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the
Conversion  Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan  Currency,  so as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
