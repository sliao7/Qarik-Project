Section  II. 

Employment  of Consultants

1.  Consultants'  services  shall be  procured  under  contracts  awarded  in  accordance  with
the  provisions  of the  "Guidelines  for  the  Use  of Consultants  by  World  Bank Borrowers
and by the World Bank as Executing  Agency" published  by the Bank in August  1981  (the
Consultant  Guidelines).  For  complex,  time-based  assignments,  such  contracts  shall  be
based  on the  standard  form  of contract  for consultants'  services  issued by the Bank,  with
such  modifications  thereto  as  shall  have  been  agreed  by  the  Bank.  Where  no  relevant
standard  contract  documents  have  been  issued  by  the  Bank,  other  standard  forms
acceptable  to  the Bank  shall  be  used.

2.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraph  1  of this Section,  the  provisions  of the
Consultant  Guidelines  requiring  prior  Bank  review  or  approval  of  budgets,  short  lists,
selection procedures,  letters of invitation, proposals,  evaluation reports  and contracts,  shall
not  apply to:  (a)  contracts  for the  employment  of consulting firms  estimated  to  cost  less
than  $100,000  equivalent  each;  or  (b)  contracts  for  the  employment  of  individuals
estimated  to  cost less  than  $50,000  equivalent  each.  However,  said  exceptions  to  prior
Bank review  shall  not apply to:  (a)  the terms  of reference  for  such  contracts;  (b)  single-

- 25  -

source  selection  of consulting  firms;  (c) assignments of a critical  nature,  as  reasonably
determined  by  the Bank;  (d) amendments  to contracts  for  the employment  of consulting
firms  raising  the  contract  value  to  $100,000  equivalent  or  above;  or (e)  amendments  to
contracts  for  the  employment  of  individual  consultants  raising  the  contract  value  to
$50,000  equivalent  or  above.

1.  For the purposes  of this  Schedule:

(a) 

the term  "eligible Categories" means Categories (1),  (2),  (3),  (4)  and (5) set forth

in  the table  in  paragraph  I  of Schedule  1 to this  Agreement;

(b)  the term  "eligible expenditures"  means expenditures  in respect of the reasonable
cost of goods and services  required  for the  Project and to be  financed out of the proceeds
of the  Loan allocated  from  time to time to  the  eligible Categories  in accordance  with  the
provisions  of Schedule  1 to  this Agreement;  and

(c) 

the term  "Authorized  Allocation"  means an  amount equivalent to  $8,000,000  to
be withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the  Special  Account  pursuant
to  paragraph  3  (a)  of this  Schedule,  provided,  however,  that  unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise  agree,  the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited to  an  amount  of $4,000,000
until the aggregate  amount  of withdrawals  from  the Loan  Account plus  the total  amount
of all outstanding  special  commitments entered  into by the Bank pursuant to  Section  5.02
of the  General  Conditions  shall  be  equal to  or exceed  the  amount of $20,000,000.

2.  Payments  out  of  the  Special  Account* shall  be  made  exclusively  for  eligible
expenditures  in  accordance  with the  provisions of this Schedule.

3.  After  the Bank  has  received  evidence  satisfactory  to it  that the  Special  Account  has
been duly opened,  withdrawals  of the Authorized  Allocation  and subsequent withdrawals
to replenish  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  as follows:

(a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,  the Borrower  shall furnish to the
Bank a request or  requests for deposit into  the Special  Account of an amount  or amounts
which do not exceed  the aggregate  amount  of the Authorized  Allocation.  On the  basis of
such  request  or requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf of the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the
Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  such  amount  or  amounts  as  the
Borrower  shall have  requested.

(b) 

(i) 

For  replenishment  of the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account
at  such intervals  as the  Bank shall  specify.

- 27  -

(ii) 

Prior  to or  at  the time  of each  such request,  the Borrower  shall
furnish  to the  Bank  the  documenits  and other  evidence  required
pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule  for  the  payment  or
payments  in respect  of which replenishment  is requested.  On  the
basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the
Borrower,  withdraw from  the Loan Account  and deposit  into the
Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have
requested  and  as  shall  have  been  shown  by  said  documents  and
other evidence  to  have been  paid out  of the  Special  Account for
eligible  expenditures.

All  such  deposits shall  be withdrawn  by the  Bank from  the Loan  Account  under
the respective  eligible Categories,  and  in the respective equivalent amounts,  as  shall have
been justified by  said documents  and  other evidence.

For  each  payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out  of  the  Special  Account,  the
4. 
Borrower  shall,  at  such  time  as  the  Bank  shall reasonably  request,  furnish  to  the  Bank
such documents and  other  evidence showing that  such payment  was made exclusively for
eligible expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraph  3 of this  Schedule,  the Bank  shall

5. 
not be required  to make  further  deposits  into the Special  Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals
should be  made by the Borrower  directly  from  the  Loan Account  in  accordance  with the
provisions  of Article  V  of the General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a) of Section  2.02  of
this Agreement;

(b) 

if the Borrower  shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period
of time  specified  in  Section  5.01  (b) (ii)  of this  Agreement,  any  of the  audit  reports
required  to be  furnished to the Bank pursuant to said  Section in respect  of the audit  of the
records  and  accounts  for the  Special  Account;

(c) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified  the Borrower  of its  intention
to  suspend in  whole or  in  part the  right  of the  Borrower  to  make withdrawals  from  the
Loan Account pursuant to the  provisions  of Section  6.02  of the General  Conditions;  or

(d) 

once  the total  unwithdrawn  amount  of the Loan  allocated  to the  eligible
Categories minus the total  amount of all  outstanding special commitments  entered  into by
the Bank  pursuant to  Section  5.02  of the  General  Conditions with  respect to the Project,
shall equal  the equivalent  of twice  the amount  of the Authorized  Allocation.  Thereafter,
withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of the  Loan

- 28  -

allocated to the  eligible Categories  shall follow  such procedures  as the Bank shall specify
by  notice to the Borrower.  Such further  withdrawals  shall be made  only after  and to  the
extent  that the  Bank  shall have been satisfied that  all such  amounts remaining  on deposit
in  the Special  Account  as of the  date  of such notice will  be utilized  in  making  payments
for  eligible  expenditures.

(a) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any payment  out of the
6. 
Special  Account:  (i)  was made  for  an  expenditure  or in an  amount not  eligible  pursuant
to paragraph  2  of this  Schedule;  or (ii)  was not justified by the  evidence  furnished  to  the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional  evidence  as the Bank  may request;  or (B)  deposit into the  Special Account  (or,
if the Bank  shall  so request,  refund  to the Bank) an  amount  equal to the  amount  of such
payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise agree,  no further  deposit by  the Bank  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be made
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund,  as the case
may be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures,  the Borrower shall, promptly  upon notice  from the Bank, refund  to the Bank
such  outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to the  Bank  all  or

any  portion  of the  funds  on  deposit  in the  Special  Account.

(d) 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs  6  (a), (b) and  (c) of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with the relevant  provisions  of this Agreement,  including the
General  Conditions.
