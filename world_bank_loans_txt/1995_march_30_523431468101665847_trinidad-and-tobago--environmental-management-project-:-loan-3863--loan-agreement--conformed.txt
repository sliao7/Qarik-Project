SCHEDULE  4

Procurement  and  Consultants'  Services

Section  I.  Procurement  of Goods

Part A:  Procurement  Procedures

1. 
Except  as  provided  in  Part  B  hereof,  goods  shall  be  procured  under  contracts
awarded  through  limited  international  bidding procedures  on the  basis of evaluation  and
comparison  of bids  obtained  from  a  list of potential  suppliers,  broad  enough  to  assure
competitive  prices  (which  list  is  to  include  all  suppliers  when  there  is  only  a  limited
number), with established services  and maintenance  facilities in Trinidad  and Tobago,  and
in accordance  with  procedures  set forth  in  Sections I and  II  of the Guidelines  (excluding
paragraphs  2.8,  2.9,  2.55,  2.56 thereof).  The Borrower  shall  submit the  list of suppliers
referred  to above  to  the  Bank  for approval  before  inviting the  relevant  bids.

(a) 

2. 
When  contract  award  is delayed  beyond the  original  bid validity period,
such  period  may  be  extended  once,  subject to and  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
paragraph  2.59  of the  Guidelines,  by  the minimum  amount of time required  to complete
the evaluation,  obtain necessary approvals  and clearances  and award the contract.  The bid
validity  period  may  be  extended  a  second  time  only  if the  bidding  documents  or  the
request  for extension  shall  provide  for  appropriate  adjustment  of the bid price  to reflect
changes  in  the  cost  of inputs  for  the  contract  over  the  period  of  extension.  Such  an
increase  of the  bid  price  shall  not  be  taken  into  account  in  the  bid  evaluation.  With
respect to  each contract  made  subject to the Bank"s  prior review  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of Part C. 1 of this Section,  the Bank's  prior approval  will  be required  for:  (i)
a first  extension  of the  bid validity  period  if the period  of extension  exceeds  sixty  (60)
days;  and (ii)  any  subsequent  extension  of the bid  validity  period.

(b) 

In the procurement  of goods in accordance  with this Part A,  the Borrower
shall  use  the  relevant  standard  bidding  documents  issued  by  the  Bank,  with  such
modifications  thereto  as the  Bank shall  have  agreed to  be  necessary  for the  purposes  of
the Project.  Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the  Bank,
the  Borrower  shall  use  bidding  documents  based  on  other  internationally  recognized
standard  forms agreed  with the Bank.

Part B:  Shoping

Goods  estimated to  cost the  equivalent  of $25,000  or  less per  contract,  up to  an
aggregate  amount  equivalent  to $250,000,  may  be procured  under contracts  awarded  on

- 18  -

the  basis of comparison  of price  quotations  obtained  from  at least three  suppliers eligible
under the  Guidelines,  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  the Bank.

Part  C:  Review  by the Bank  of Procurement  Decisions

1. 

Review  of invitations  to  bid  and  of proposed  awards  and  final  contracts:

(a) 

With respect  to each  contract to be awarded  pursuant to the provisions of
Part  A  of this  Section,  the  procedures  set  forth  in  paragraphs  2  and  4 of Appendix  1 to
the  Guidelines  shall apply.  Where payments  for  such  contract  are  to  be made  out  of the
Special  Account,  such  procedures  shall  be  modified  to  ensure  that  the  two  conformed
copies  of the contract  required  to be furnished  to the  Bank pursuant  to said  paragraph  2
(d) shall  be  furnished  to the  Bank prior  to  the  making  of the  first  payment  out  of the
Special  Account  in  respect of such  contract.

(b)  With  respect to  each  contract  not governed  by the  preceding  paragraph,
the  procedures  set forth  in  paragraphs  3 and  4  of Appendix  1 to  the  Guidelines  shall
apply. Where  payments for such contract are to be made out  of the  Special Account,  said
procedures  shall  be  modified  to  ensure  that  the  two  conformed  copies  of the  contract
together  with the other  information  required to  be furnished  to the Bank pursuant to  said
paragraph  3  shall  be  furnished  to  the  Bank  as  part  of  the  evidence  to  be  furnished
pursuant  to paragraph  4 of Schedule  5 to this Agreement.

(c) 

The  provisions  of  the  preceding  subparagraph  (b)  shall  not  apply  to
contracts  on  account  of which  withdrawals  are  to be  made  on the  basis of statements  of
expenditure.

The  figure  of 10%  is hereby  specified  for  purposes  of paragraph  4  of Appendix

2. 
1 to  the  Guidelines.

Section  II. Employment  of Consultants

In  order  to  assist the  Borrower  in  carrying  out the  Project,  the Borrower  shall
1. 
employ  consultants  whose  qualifications,  experience  and  terms  and  conditions  of
employment  shall  be  satisfactory  to  the  Bank.  Such  consultants  shall  be  selected  in
accordance  with  principles  and  procedures  satisfactory  to  the  Bank  on  the  basis of the
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants  by World  Bank Borrowers  and by the World Bank
as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981  (the Consultant Guidelines).
For complex,  time-based assignments,  the Borrower  shall employ such consultants under
contracts  using the standard  form  of contract for consultants'  services issued by the Bank,
with  such  modifications  as  shall  have  been  agreed  by  the  Bank.  Where  no  relevant

- 19  -

standard contract  documents have  been issued by  the Bank,  the Borrower  shall  use other
standard forms  agreed  with the Bank.

2. 
Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraph  I of this Section, the provisions  of
the Consultant Guidelines requiring  prior Bank  review  or approval  of budgets, short  lists,
selection  procedures,  letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation  reports and contracts  shall
not apply to: (a)  contracts  for  the employment  of consulting  firms  estimated to cost less
than  $100,000  equivalent  each;  or  (b)  contracts  for  the  employment  of  individuals
estimated to cost less than  $50,000 equivalent each. However, this exception to prior Bank
review  shall not apply to:  (a)  the terms of reference  for  such contracts;  (b) single-source
selection  of  consulting  firms;  (c)  assignments  of  a  critical  nature,  as  reasonably
determined  by the Bank;  (d)  amendments  to contracts  for the  employment  of consulting
firms  raising the  contract  value  to $100,000  equivalent  or  above;  or (e)  amendments  to
contracts  for  the  employment  of  individual  consultants  raising  the  contract  value  to
$50,000  equivalent or above.

1. 

For the purposes  of this  Schedule:

(a) 

the  term  "eligible  Categories"  means  categories  (1)  through  (3)  of the

table  set  forth  in paragraph  1 of Schedule  1 to this  Agreement;

(b) 

the  term  "eligible  expenditures"  means  expenditures  in  respect  of  the
reasonable  cost of goods and  services  required  for  the Project  and  to be  financed  out  of
the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  eligible  Categories  in
accordance  with  the  provisions  of Schedule  1 to this Agreement;  and

(c) 

the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to $400,000
to be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  in  the  Special  Account  pursuant
to  paragraph  3  (a)  of  this  Schedule,  provided,  however,  that  unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise  agree,  the Authorized  Allocation  shall  be limited  to  an  amount  equivalent  to
$200,000 until the aggregate  amount of withdrawals  from the Loan Account plus the total
amount  of  all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to
Section  5.02  of  the  General  Conditions  shall  be  equal  to  or  exceed  the  equivalent  of
$750,000.

Payments  out  of  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  exclusively  for  eligible

2. 
expenditures  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of this Schedule.

After  the  Bank  has  received  evidence  satisfactory  to  it that the  Special  Account
3. 
has  been  duly  opened,  withdrawals  of  the  Authorized  Allocation  and  subsequent
withdrawals  to  replenish  the  Special  Account  shall  be made  as  follows:

(a) 

For withdrawals  of the Authorized  Allocation, the Borrower  shall furnish
to  the  Bank  a  request  or  requests  for  a  deposit  or  deposits  which  do  not  exceed  the
aggregate  amount of the  Authorized  Allocation.  On  the basis of such request or requests,
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw  from  the Loan Account and  deposit
in the  Special  Account  such amount  or  amounts  as the  Borrower  shall have  requested.

(b) 

(i) 

(ii) 

For replenishment  of the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall
furnish  to  the  Bank  requests  for  deposits  into  the  Special
Account  at such  intervals  as the  Bank shall  specify.
Prior to or  at the time  of each  such request,  the Borrower  shall
furnish  to the  Bank the documents  and other  evidence required

- 21  -

pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule  for the  payment  or
payments  in respect of which replenishment is requested.  On the
basis  of each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the
Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have
requested  and  as shall have been shown  by  said documents  and
other evidence to have  been paid  out of the Special Account  for
eligible  expenditures.

All  such  deposits  shall  be  withdrawn  by  the  Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under  the
respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts,  as shall have been
justified by  said documents  and  other  evidence.

4. 
For  each  payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out  of  the  Special  Account,  the
Borrower  shall,  at such  time  as  the  Bank shall  reasonably  request,  furnish  to  the  Bank
such documents  and other evidence  showing that such payment was  made exclusively for
eligible  expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraph  3 of this Schedule,  the Bank  shall

5. 
not  be required  to make further  deposits  into the  Special  Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals
should be made by the Borrower  directly  from  the Loan Account in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of Article  V  of the  General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a) of Section  2.02  of
this Agreement;  or

(b) 

if the Borrower  shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period
of time  specified  in  Section  4.01  (b)  (ii)  of this  Agreement,  any  of the  audit reports
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section  in respect  of the audit  of the
records  and  accounts for  the Special  Account;  or

(c) 

if, at any time, the Bank  shall have notified  the Borrower  of its intention
to  suspend  in  whole  or  in part  the  right  of the  Borrower  to make  withdrawals  from  the
Loan  Account pursuant  to the  provisions  of Section  6.02  of the General  Conditions;  or

(d) 

once the total  unwithdrawn  amount  of the  Loan  allocated  to the eligible
Categories,  less  the  amount  of any  outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by  the
Bank pursuant to  Section  5.02 of the General  Conditions with  respect to the Project,  shall
equal  the equivalent  of twice  the amount  of the  Authorized  Allocation.

- 22  -

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the Loan Account  of the remaining  unwithdrawn  amount of
the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such procedures  as  the  Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals  shall be made only after
and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied  that all such  amounts remaining
on deposit in  the Special  Account as of the date of such notice will  be utilized  in  making
payments  for  eligible expenditures.

(a) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any payment out of the
6. 
Special Account:  (i) was made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an amount  not  eligible  pursuant
to  paragraph  2  of this  Schedule;  or (ii)  was  not justified by the evidence  furnished to the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional  evidence  as the Bank may request;  or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or,
if the  Bank shall so request, refund  to the Bank) an  amount  equal  to the amount of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank  shall otherwise
agree,  no  further  deposit by the  Bank  into  the Special  Account  shall  be  made  until  the
Borrower  has provided  such evidence  or made  such deposit or  refund,  as the  case  may
be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures,  the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank
such outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The Borrower  may,  upon  notice to  the Bank,  refund  to  the Bank  all  or

any portion  of the  funds  on deposit  in  the Special  Account.

(d) 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs  6 (a),  (b)  and (c) of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the relevant  provisions  of this Agreement,  including  the
General  Conditions.
