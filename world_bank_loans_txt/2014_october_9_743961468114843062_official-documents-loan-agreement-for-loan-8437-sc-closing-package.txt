Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
