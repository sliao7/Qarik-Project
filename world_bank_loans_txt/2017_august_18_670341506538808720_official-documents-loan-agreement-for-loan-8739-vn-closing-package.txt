of interest  shall be ineligible  for award  of a  contract.  The provisions on conflict of interest
as  stated under  Section  I of the Procurement  Guidelines  shall apply.

Conflict  of Interest

Eligibility

2. 
The  eligibility  of bidders  shall  be  as  defined  under  Section  I  of the  Procurement
Guidelines;  accordingly,  no  bidder  or  potential  bidder  shall  be  declared  ineligible  for
contracts  financed  by the Bank/Bank  for reasons  other than those provided  in  Section I  of
the  Guidelines.  Foreign bidders  shall  be  eligible  to  participate  in bidding under  the  same
conditions  as national  bidders.  In particular,  no domestic  preference  over  foreign bidders
shall  be granted to  national bidders  in bid evaluation,  nor shall  foreign bidders be  asked  or
required  to  form joint  ventures  with or  be  subcontractors  to  national  bidders  in order  to
submit  a bid.

3. 
Government-owned  enterprises  or  institutions  of  the  Borrower's  country  are

criteria  other than price;  merit points  shall  not  be  used in  bid  evaluation.  No  bid  shall be
eliminated  from detailed  evaluation  on the  basis of minor, non-substantive  deviations.  The
evaluation  of bidder's  qualifications  shall  be  conducted  separately  subsequent  to  the
technical  and commercial  evaluation  of the bid.

A  contract  shall be awarded, within the period of the validity of bids, to the bidder
8.

No bid  shall be rejected on the basis of a comparison with the employer's estimate

9. 
and budget ceiling without the Bank's/Bank's prior written agreement.

Rejection  of All  Bids and Re-bidding

Rejection  of all bids  is justified when there  is lack of effective  competition,  or all

bids are not substantially responsive, or no bidder meets the  specified qualification criteria,
or  the  bid  price  of  the  lowest  evaluated  winning  bid  is  substantially  higher  than  the
Borrower's  updated  estimated  cost  or  available  budget.  All  bids  shall  not  be  rejected  or
new bids  solicited without the  Bank's prior written  agreement.
