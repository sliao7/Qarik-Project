any standard contract estimate or margin or bracket of average bid prices 
established by the Borrower.

substantially  responsive  to  the  bidding  documents;  and  (B)  to  offer  the 
lowest  evaluated  cost.  The  winning  bidder  shall  not  be  required,  as  a 
condition of award, to undertake responsibilities for work not stipulated 
in  the  bidding  documents  or  otherwise  to  modify  the  bid  as  originally 
submitted.

documents  and  contract  shall  provide  that  bidders,  suppliers  and

national  press  or  provincial  press  (as  provided  under  3(i)  above)  or
