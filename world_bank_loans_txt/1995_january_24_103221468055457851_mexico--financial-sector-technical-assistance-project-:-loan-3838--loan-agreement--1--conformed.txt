such documents and  other evidence  showing that such payment was made exclusively for
eligible  expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraph  3  of this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall

5. 
not  be  required  to make  further  deposits into  the Special  Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals
should  be made by the Borrower  directly  from  the Loan Account  in accordance  with the
provisions  of Article  V of the  General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a)  of Section  2.02  of
this Agreement;  or

(b) 

if the Borrower  shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period
of time  specified  in  Section  4.01  (b)  (ii)  of this  Agreement,  any  of the  audit  reports
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect  of the audit of the
records  and  accounts  for  the Special  Account;

(c) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have  notified the Borrower  of its intention
to  suspend in  whole  or in  part the  right  of the  Borrower  to  make  withdrawals  from  the
Loan Account  pursuant  to the provisions  of Section  6.02  of the General  Conditions;  or

- 17  -

(d) 

once the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of the  Loan allocated  to the  eligible
Categories,  less  the  amount  of any  outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by the
Bank pursuant to  Section  5.02  of the General  Conditions with respect to the Project, shall
equal  the  equivalent  of twice  the amount  of the  Authorized  Allocation.

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from the Loan  Account of the remaining  unwithdrawn  amount of
the  Loan  allocated  to the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank
shall specify  by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals  shall be made  only after
and to  the extent that  the Bank shall  have been  satisfied that all  such  amounts remaining
on deposit in  the Special  Account  as of the date of such notice will  be utilized  in making
payments  for  eligible  expenditures.

(a) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any payment out of the
6. 
Special Account:  (i)  was made  for  an expenditure  or in an  amount  not eligible  pursuant
to  paragraph  2  of this Schedule;  or (ii)  was not justified by the  evidence  furnished  to the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional evidence  as the Bank  may request;  or (B)  deposit  into the  Special Account (or,
if the Bank shall  so request,  refund  to the Bank) an  amount  equal  to the amount of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree,  no  further  deposit by  the  Bank  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  until  the
Borrower  has  provided  such evidence  or  made  such  deposit or  refund,  as  the  case  may
be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures,  the Borrower shall, promptly  upon notice from  the Bank, refund to the Bank
such outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to the  Bank,  refund  to the  Bank all  or

any  portion of the  funds  on deposit  in  the  Special  Account.

(d) 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs  6 (a),  (b) and (c)  of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions of this Agreement,  including  the
General  Conditions.
