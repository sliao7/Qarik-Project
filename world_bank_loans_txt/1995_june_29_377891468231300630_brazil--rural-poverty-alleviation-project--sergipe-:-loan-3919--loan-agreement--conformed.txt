If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any payment out of the
Special  Account:  (i) was made  for  an  expenditure  or in  an amount not eligible  pursuant

Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional evidence  as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special  Account (or,

payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit by the Bank  into the  Special  Account  shall  be made
until the Borrower has provided such evidence  or made such deposit or refund,  as the case
may be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly  upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank
such outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to the  Bank,  refund  to the  Bank  all  or

any portion  of the  funds on  deposit in  the  Special  Account.

(d)
