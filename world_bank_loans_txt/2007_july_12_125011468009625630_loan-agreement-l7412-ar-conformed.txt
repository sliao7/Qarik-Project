percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the 
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
determined by the  Bank  by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance  as of the 
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any

Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date

(a) 

 
(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the 
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn 
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of  this 
Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such 
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount 
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the 
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this 
Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (“Original  Installment  Share”) 
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original 
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such 
date,  such amounts repayable to be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

- 21 -

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the 
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as 
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal 
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 

 

4. 

 
5. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions  of  sub-paragraph (a) of this  paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals 
made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of 
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate 
that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the 
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if 
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each 
such amount.
