(a) 

Thereafter,  withdrawal from  the  Loan  Account  of the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall 
specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 
to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that  all  such  amounts  remaining  on 
deposit  in  said  Special  Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making 
payments for eligible expenditures. 
 
6. 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of a 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, 
the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such  additional 
evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into said Special Account (or, if the Bank 
shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the 
portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further 
deposit  by  the  Bank  into  said  Special  Account  shall  be  made  until  the  Borrower  has 
provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in  said  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank 
such outstanding amount. 

The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 

portion of the funds on deposit in said Special Account. 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this 
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  this  Agreement,  including  the 
General Conditions.
