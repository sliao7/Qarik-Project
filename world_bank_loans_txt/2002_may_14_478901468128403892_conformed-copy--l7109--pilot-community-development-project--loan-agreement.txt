SCHEDULE 3

Amortization Schedule

1.
The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date 
(Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) the total principal 
amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the 
Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as 
necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a 
Currency Conversion applies.

If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
2. 
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a)

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and outstanding as 
of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

(b)

Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by 
the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of 
which  shall  be  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original Installment Share) and the denominator 
of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment 
Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  repayment  amounts  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to 
deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies.

(a)

3.
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal  Payment 
Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal 
Payment Date,  be treated  as withdrawn and  outstanding on the  second Principal  Payment Date 
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of  withdrawal.

(b)

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if at any 
time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after 
the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer 
apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 

4.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan to an Approved 
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  said  Approved  Currency  that  shall  be  repayable  on  any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank 
by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  said 
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  said 
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time shall be 
5.
denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply 
separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate 
amortization schedule for each amount.

the  term  “eligible  Categories”  means  Categories  (1),  (2),  (3),  (4),  and  (5)  set 

forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

(b)

the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the reasonable 
cost of goods, works and services required for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds 
of  the  Loan  allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  eligible  Categories  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c)

the  term  “Authorized  Allocation”  means  the  amount  of  $900,000  to  be 
withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 
3 (a)  of  this  Schedule;  provided,  however,  that  unless  the  Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  the 
Authorized Allocation shall be limited to the amount of $450,000 until the aggregate amount of 
withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account,  plus  the  total  amount  of  all  outstanding  special 
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall 
equal or exceed the equivalent of $1,500,000.

Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures 

2.
in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been 
3.
duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish 
the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a)

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which 
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and 
deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b)

(i)

For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account at such intervals 
as the Bank shall specify.

(ii)

Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the  Bank  the  documents  and  other  evidence  required  pursuant  to 
para-graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of 
which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 
have  requested  and  as  shall  have  been  shown  by  said  documents  and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for eligible 
expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the 

Loan  Account  under  the  respective  eligible  Categories,  and  in  the 
respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall  have  been  justified  by  said 
documents and other evidence.

For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower shall, 
4.
at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  3  of  this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall  not  be 

5.
required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a)

if,  at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  that  all  further  withdrawals 
should  be  made  by  the  Borrower  directly  from  the  Loan  Account  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions  of  Article  V  of  the  General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a)  of  Section  2.02  of  this 
Agreement;

(b)

if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period of time 
specified  in  Section  4.01  (b)  (ii)  of  this  Agreement,  any  of  the  audit  reports  required  to  be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts 
for the Special Account;

(c)

if,  at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have  notified  the  Borrower  of  its  intention  to 
suspend  in  whole  or  in  part  the  right  of  the  Borrower  to  make  withdrawals  from  the  Loan 
Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

(d)

once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible 
Categories,  minus  the  total  amount  of  all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  into  by  the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank  shall 
specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the 
extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the 
Special  Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  eligible 
expenditures.

(a)

6.
If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the 
Special  Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible  pursuant  to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the 
Bank  may  request;  or  (B)  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  (or,  if  the  Bank  shall  so  request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so 
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into 
the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b)

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  such  outstanding 

amount.

(c)

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or  any 

portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d)

Refunds  to  the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of  this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
