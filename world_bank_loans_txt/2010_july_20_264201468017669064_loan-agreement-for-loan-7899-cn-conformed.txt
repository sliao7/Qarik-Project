The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage  of the  total  principal amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on each  Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the 
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency 
Conversion applies.

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
(a) 
the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan 
Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
(b) 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal 
in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of  each  such 
withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the  original  Installment 
Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal 
Payment  Date  (“Original  Installment  Share”)  and  the  denominator  of  which  is 
the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates 
falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as 
necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to 
which a Currency Conversion applies.

(a) 
Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two (2) calendar months prior to 
any  Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the 
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as 
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the 
date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date 
commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of 
withdrawal. 

(b) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such 
sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption 
of such billing system.  

Notwithstanding  the  provisions of  paragraphs 1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  (1)  Loan 
Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount 
denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization 
schedule for each such amount.
