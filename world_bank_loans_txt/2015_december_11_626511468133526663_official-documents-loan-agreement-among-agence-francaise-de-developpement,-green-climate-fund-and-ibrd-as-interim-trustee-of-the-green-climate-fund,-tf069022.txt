ARTICLE  2  - THE  LOAN

2.1 
The  Lender  irrevocably  agrees  to  lend  to  the  Fund,  on  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  or
referred to in this Loan  Agreement, the Loan in the amount of two hundred and eighty-five million Euros
(EUR 285,000,000)  for the purpose  of making a Loan  Contribution  to the Trust  Fund. For the avoidance
of doubt,  the  Loan Contribution  does  not  constitute a  loan to  the Trust Fund.  The amount  of the  Loan,
including the principal repayments,  shall be denominated  in Euros.

2.2 
The Loan  shall  consist  of one  Drawdown.  Upon  satisfaction  of the  condition precedent  to the
Drawdown  specified  in  Section  4.2  and Annex  II  (Conditions  Precedent)  to this  Loan  Agreement,  the
Lender  and  the  Fund  shall  agree  in  writing  in  advance  on  the  Drawdown  Date,  which  shall,  unless
otherwise  agreed  between  the  Lender  and  the Fund,  fall  on a  Business  Day  between  1 February  2017
and 30 November  2017. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the parties  acknowledge  that  as  of the  date  of
this Loan  Agreement,  the  Bank's  role as  the interim  trustee  of the  Trust Fund  terminates  on 30  April
2018  under  paragraph  8.4  of the  GCF  Trust  Fund  Agreement.  The  Trustee  will  not  request  any
Drawdown  of the  Loan  if the  Bank  is  not  the  Trustee of the  Trust Fund  as  of the  Drawdown  Date,  in
which  case  the  provisions  of paragraph  8.6  of the  GCF  Trust  Fund  Agreement,  paragraph  5.4  of the
Standard  Provisions and  Section  8.6  of this  Loan Agreement  shall apply.

2.3 
Upon  agreement  by  the Lender  and  the  Fund in  Section  2.2, the  Secretariat  shall,  by not  less
than twenty-five  (25) Business  Days prior to the Drawdown  Date, send a Written Instruction,  specifying
the  Drawdown  Date  to  the  Trustee.  By  sending  such  Written  Instruction  to  the  Trustee,  the  Fund
irrevocably  and  unconditionally  authorizes  the  Trustee,  and  the Trustee  shall,  subject  to  Section  2.2,
within  ten  (10)  Business  Days  from  its receipt  of such  instruction,  request  the  Drawdown  of the  full
amount  of the  Loan  as  set out  in  Section 2.1  by delivering  to the  Lender  a  Drawdown  Request.  If the
Drawdown  Request  is  not  received  by  the  Lender  as  specified  in  this  Section  2.3,  the  Lender  shall
promptly notify the Fund and the Trustee in writing thereof. If, subsequent  to such notice, the Drawdown
Request  shall not have been  received  by the Lender at least twenty-five  (25)  Business  Days  prior to  31
December  2020,  unless  agreed  otherwise  by  the  Lender  and  the  Fund,  the  Loan  shall  be  deemed
cancelled as  of 31  December  2020.

2.4 
Upon receipt  of the  Drawdown  Request,  the Lender  shall,  on the Drawdown  Date,  deposit the
amount  in  Euros  into  the account  designated  by the  Trustee  in the  Drawdown  Request.  When  making
such deposit, the Lender shall instruct  its bank to include  in its payment details  information  (remittance
advice)  field  of  its  SWIFT  payment  message,  the  deposit  instructions  which  include  information
indicating:  the  amount  paid,  that  the  payment  is made  by  the  Lender  for  MTO  No.  069022  (Green
Climate Fund),  and the date of the  deposit. The Trustee  shall promptly  notify  the Lender  and the  Fund
of the  amount  of the proceeds  it received  in  Euros.  Upon  receipt by  the  Fund of the notification  from
the  Trustee  on  the  amount  of the proceeds  it  received,  the  Fund  shall  promptly  send  a  notice  to  the
Lender and the Trustee  confirming  (i) the amount  of the  Loan  under this  Loan Agreement,  and (ii)  the
schedule  for its repayment  in Euros in  accordance  with the terms  of this  Loan Agreement.

-3-

The proceeds  of the  Loan  shall be credited  to the  Trust Fund  as  the Loan  Contribution  by  the
2.5 
Lender to  be  used  and administered  in  accordance  with the  GCF Trust  Fund Agreement.  The  Lender
confirms that it  has received  a  copy of the GCF Trust Fund Agreement.

The Bank  shall act under  this Loan  Agreement  solely in its  capacity as trustee of the Trust Fund
2.6 
and neither in its individual  or personal capacity nor as borrower,  guarantor or  surety.  The Trustee shall
be responsible only for performing those  functions specifically  set forth in this Loan Agreement  and the
GCF Trust  Fund Agreement,  and shall not be subject to  any other duties  or responsibilities  to the Fund
or the  Lender.  The  Trustee  shall  not  be  responsible  for  any determination  made  by  the  Fund  or  the
Secretariat  under this  Loan  Agreement,  and may  rely in  good faith  on any instruction provided  by the
Fund or  the  Secretariat  under this  Loan Agreement  without  further  inquiry or investigation  on its part,
and  shall have no liability for relying in good  faith on  any such  instruction  or otherwise  for any actions
taken,  or  omitted to  be taken,  in good  faith.  Absent any gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct  on the
part of the Trustee,  the Trustee's liability  under this Loan Agreement  shall  in  any event be limited  to the
extent  of the resources  made  available  in  the  Trust  Fund pursuant  to  the  GCF  Trust Fund  Agreement
and  this Loan Agreement.

ARTICLE 3 - TERM AND  PRINCIPAL  REPAYMENTS

3.1 

No  interest shall accrue  or be payable  on the  Loan.

Subject to the provisions of Section  5.2, the Loan shall be repaid in forty (40) equal semi-annual
3.2 
installments  on June  15  and December  15  of each year, with  the first such  repayment occurring on June
15  or December  15,  whichever occurs  first following sixty (60)  months  after the  Drawdown  Date.

Upon  giving not less than  thirty  (30)  Business  Days'  prior  written notice  to the Lender  (with  a
3.3 
copy to the Trustee),  the  Fund may prepay the  Outstanding  Loan  Balance,  in whole or in part without
penalty.

Unless  otherwise  specified  in the  Standard  Provisions,  the Lender  shall  not  have  the  right  to

3.4 
demand any payment  under this Loan Agreement  in advance  of maturity.

ARTICLE 4  - CUSHION

The  Lender  and  the  Fund  acknowledge 

that  the  Cushion  Contributor  shall  provide  a
4.1 
Contribution in the amount  of fifty seven million Euros (EUR 57,000,000)  to the Trust Fund to serve as
France's Cushion,  in accordance  with the Cushion  Contribution  Agreement.

The payment  of the  full  amount  of the  France's  Cushion  specified  in  Section 4.1  to  the  Trust
4.2 
Fund  by  the  Cushion  Contributor  is  a  condition  precedent  to  Drawdown,  as  specified  in  Annex  II
(Conditions  Precedent).

The Fund shall be responsible  for ensuring that France's  Cushion is used in accordance  with the
4.3 
terms  of this  Loan  Agreement,  the  Cushion  Contribution  Agreement  and  the  Applicable  Policies.
France's Cushion  shall  only be used  to make repayments  of the Outstanding  Loan  Balance  due  by the
Fund to the  Lender under this  Loan  Agreement,  and  not  to  any other  lenders,  as set  out in Section  5.2
below.

ARTICLE 5 - LIMITED RECOURSE;  PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT  ARRANGEMENTS

5.1 
The Lender agrees that  any repayment  obligations  of the Fund hereunder  shall be limited to the
available  Individual  Lender's  Loan  Resources  and  France's  Cushion  held  in  the  Trust  Fund, and  the
Lender shall  not have any recourse against any other assets of the Fund or the Trust Fund. The Secretariat
shall,  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of the  Standard  Provisions,  the  Applicable  Policies,  including
International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  and  this  Loan  Agreement,  determine  the  amount  of the
Individual  Lender's  Loan  Resources  and  France's  Cushion  available  in the Trust Fund for the purpose
of making  any repayment  of the Outstanding  Loan  Balance  under Sections  3.2,  3.3  and/or 5.2.  For the
purpose  of this  Loan  Agreement,  the  Individual  Lender's  Loan  Resources  shall  be  determined,  in
relation  to  each  Principal  Repayment  Date,  by  firstly,  deducting  from  the  Lenders'  Loan  Resources
available in the Trust Fund the total amount  of resources  to be applied for the reimbursement  of France's
Cushion  in  accordance  with  Section  5.2(ii)  and  for  the  reimbursement  of other  lenders'  respective
Cushions  in  a  similar  manner  as  Section  5.2(ii)  at  that  Principal  Repayment  Date,  as  applicable,  and
secondly,  calculating the pro rata share of the remaining  Lenders'  Loan Resources available  in the Trust
Fund based  on  the amount  of the payment  payable  under  this  Loan  Agreement  to  the  Lender  at  that
Principal  Repayment  Date,  relative  to  the  total  amounts  of  payments  payable  under  all  Loan
Agreements/Arrangements  at that Principal  Repayment  Date.

(i) 

5.2 
If two  (2)  months  prior  to  any  Principal  Repayment  Date,  the  Secretariat  determines
that the  Individual  Lender's  Loan  Resources  available  in  the  Trust  Fund are  less than  the  amount  due
and payable under this Loan Agreement,  the payment  on such Principal  Repayment  Date shall be  made
only to the extent of such Individual  Lender's Loan Resources  available,  and:

(A) 

(B) 

If the  Secretariat  determines  that  any part  or  all  of the insufficient  Individual
Lender's  Loan Resources are due to financial  losses from non-performing loans
extended  by  the  Fund  under  paragraph  3.3(d)  of the  Standard  Provisions  as
determined  by the  Secretariat  ("Non-Performing  Loans"),  the  Secretariat  shall
(a)  use  any  available  France's  Cushion  to  pay  the  amount  representing  the
difference  between  the  Individual  Lender's  Loan  Resources  available  in  the
Trust  Fund  and  the  scheduled  Principal  Repayment  Amount  (the  "Unpaid
Amount"),  and  (b)  in the event of insufficient  France's  Cushion, write off any
or  all of such  portion of the Unpaid  Amount.

If the Secretariat  determines, in respect to  any Principal  Repayment  Date other
than  a  last  scheduled  Principal  Repayment  Date,  that  any  part  or  all  of the
insufficient  Individual  Lender's  Loan  Resources  are  due to  any reasons  other
than  financial  losses  from  Non-Performing  Loans,  the Secretariat  shall  (a)  use
any available  France's Cushion  to pay the Unpaid Amount  and (b) in the event
of  insufficient  France's  Cushion,  carry  forward  any  and  all  portion  of the
Unpaid Amount  remaining unpaid after (a)  above,  and add such amount  to  the
scheduled  Principal  Repayment  Amount  due  and  payable  at  the  following
Principal  Repayment  Date  and the Outstanding  Loan Balance  shall be adjusted
by  the  Secretariat  accordingly.  The  Secretariat  shall  also  promptly  notify  the
Lender  and  the  Trustee  of  the  revised  schedule  for  the  repayment  of  the
Outstanding  Loan  Balance  to  reflect  such  carrying  forward  of  the  Unpaid
Amount.

-5-

(C) 

If the Secretariat determines,  in respect of a last scheduled  Principal Repayment
Date, that  the  insufficient  Individual  Lender's  Loan  Resources  are  due to  any
reasons  other than financial  losses  from  Non-Performing  Loans, and:

(x) 

(y) 

the  Secretariat  determines  that  all  Individual  Lender's  Loan  Reflows
(excluding  those  amounts of financial  losses from the Non-Performing
Loans,  against which any portion of the Unpaid  Amount has been paid
through  the  use  of  France's  Cushion  or  written  off  under  Section
5.2(i)(A))  have  been  collected  by  the  Fund  in  accordance  with
Applicable  Policies  approved  by  the  Board, then  any  shortfall  of the
repayment of the Outstanding Loan  Balance shall be paid from the then
available  France's  Cushion on the last scheduled Principal  Repayment
Date, and to the extent there is insufficient available  France's Cushion,
any shortfall  of the  repayment  of the  Outstanding  Loan Balance  shall
be  written  off  by  the  Secretariat  on  the  last  scheduled  Principal
Repayment  Date;  or

the Secretariat  determines  that  any Individual  Lender's  Loan Reflows
(excluding those amounts  of financial  losses from  the Non-Performing
Loans,  against  which any portion of the Unpaid Amount  has been paid
through  the  use  of France's  Cushion  or  written  off  under  Section
5.2(i)(A))  have  not  been  collected  by  the  Fund  in  accordance  with
Applicable  Policies  approved  by  the  Board,  then,  notwithstanding
Section  3.2, 
the  schedule  for  the  remaining  repayment  of  the
Outstanding  Loan  Balance  shall  be  revised by  the  Secretariat,  taking
into account  the amounts  and timing of when  such Individual  Lender's
Loan Reflows  are expected  to  be collected  by the  Fund as determined
by  the  Secretariat.  In  such  case,  the  Secretariat  shall  promptly  notify
the  Lender  and  the  Trustee  of the  revised schedule  for the repayment
of the  Outstanding  Loan  Balance  on  the  new  Principal  Repayment
Dates.  For greater  clarity,  the  Secretariat  may  revise  the  schedule  for
the  remaining  repayment  of  the  Outstanding  Loan  Balance 
in
accordance  with  this  Section  5.2(i)(C)(y)  until 
the  Secretariat
determines  that all Individual  Lender's  Loan  Reflows (excluding those
amounts  of financial  losses  from the Non-Performing  Loans,  against
which any portion of the Unpaid Amount has been paid through  the use
of France's  Cushion  or  written  off under  Section  5.2(i)(A))  will  have
been  collected  by  the  Fund  in  accordance  with  Applicable  Policies
approved by  the Board.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Secretariat
may  only  revise  the  payment  schedule  to  the  extent  that  the  last
Principal  Repayment  Date  under  any new  schedule  shall  not  extend
beyond  five (5)  years  from  the original  last  Principal  Repayment  Date
specified  in  the  notice  from  the  Fund  to  the  Lender  and  the  Trustee
pursuant  to  Section  2.4,  unless  otherwise  agreed  in  writing  by  the
Lender,  the Fund  and  the  Trustee.  The provisions  of Section 5.2  shall
apply to  the payments  to be made under  any new payment schedule.  If
the  payment  schedule  may  not  be  revised  further  under  this  Section
5.2(i)(C)(y),  and  if the  Secretariat  determines  two  (2)  months prior  to
the last Principal Repayment  Date thereunder that there are insufficient
Individual Lender's  Loan  Resources,  any shortfall  of the repayment of
the Outstanding  Loan  Balance  shall  be  paid  from  the  then  available

-6-

France's  Cushion  on  the  last  Principal  Repayment  Date,  and  to  the
extent there  is  insufficient  available  France's Cushion,  any  shortfall  of
the repayment  of the Outstanding Loan Balance  shall be  written  off by
the  Secretariat  on the last Principal  Repayment  Date.

(ii) 

In the event the Secretariat  determines  that any amount  of the Individual  Lender's Loan
Reflows,  against  which  any  amount  of France's  Cushion  has  been  used  under  Sections  5.2(i)(B)  and
(i)(C)(y)  for  cases  where  the  insufficient  Individual  Lender's  Loan  Resources  are  due  to any reasons
other than  financial  losses from Non-Performing  Loans, have been collected,  such  amount of Individual
Lender's  Loan  Reflows  as  determined  by  the  Secretariat  shall  be  applied  for  reimbursing  France's
Cushion  at  the  immediately  following  Principal  Repayment  Date.  The  reimbursement  of  France's
Cushion  under  this  Section  5.2(ii) may be made  up  to the date  falling five  (5)  years  from  the  original
last  Principal  Repayment  Date  specified  in  the  notice  from  the  Fund  to  the  Lender  and  the  Trustee
pursuant to  Section  2.4, unless otherwise  agreed  in  writing by  the Lender,  the  Fund and  the Trustee.  If
any date of reimbursement  falls  after all payments to the Lender under this  Loan Agreement  have been
made in full,  such  amount  of reimbursement  shall be added  to the amount  of the Grant  Contribution  in
accordance  with paragraph  3.4 of the  Standard Provisions.

(iii)  Within  twenty (20)  Business  Days prior to the Principal  Repayment  Date in relation  to
which any repayment  of the Outstanding  Loan Balance  shall be written off, the  Secretariat  shall notify
the  Lender  and  the Trustee  in  writing of the amount  and the  date of the  repayment  of the  Outstanding
Loan  Balance  to be written off. The Lender  and  the Fund  acknowledge  that  any amount  so written off
in  accordance  with the provisions  of this  Section 5.2  shall no longer  be considered  due  and payable  by
the Fund to the  Lender under this Loan Agreement,  following such notification by the  Secretariat.

Following  determination by the Secretariat of the available  resources under  Sections 5.1  and 5.2
5.3 
above,  and no  later than  ten  (10)  Business  Days, but  no earlier  than  thirty (30)  Business  Days, prior to
any  Principal  Repayment  Date,  the  Secretariat  shall  deliver  to  the  Trustee  a  Written  Instruction
instructing  the  amount  of repayment  of the  Outstanding  Loan  Balance  to  be  made  under  this  Loan
Agreement  on  such  Principal  Repayment  Date.  With  the  Secretariat's  delivery  of such  Written
Instruction  to  the  Trustee,  the  Fund  irrevocably  and  unconditionally  authorizes  the  Trustee,  and  the
Trustee agrees,  to process  such  repayment of the Outstanding  Loan Balance  in accordance  with, and to
the extent of, the Written  Instruction and in accordance  with the  provisions of Article  5.

Subject  to  the  provisions  of Section  5.3,  the  Trustee  shall  transfer  to  the  Lender,  on  each
5.4 
Principal  Repayment  Date and  out of the Trust Fund resources  held by it,  the  amount  so  instructed  by
the Secretariat  in the Written  Instruction,  as payments  under Sections  3.2,  3.3  and/or  5.2,  as applicable.

Except  as  otherwise  agreed  by  the parties,  any payment  under this  Loan  Agreement  shall  be

5.5 
made in Euros.

Any  payment  which is  due to be made  on  a day that  is  not a  Business  Day that  is a  TARGET

5.6 
Day shall be made  on the next  Business  Day that  is a  TARGET Day.

All  payments by the Trustee under this Loan Agreement  shall be paid to the bank account of the
5.7 
Lender  designated by the  Lender to the Trustee  in  writing on the  date hereof, or to  such other  account
designated  by  the  Lender  to  the  Trustee  in  writing  no  less  than  thirty  (30)  Business  Days  prior to  a
relevant  Principal  Repayment  Date.

ARTICLE  8  - AMENDMENTS  AND  WAIVERS;  SEVERABILITY;  COUNTERPARTS

This  Loan  Agreement  may  be amended  only  in writing  among  the  Fund,  the Trustee  and  the

8.1 
Lender.

If the Board adopts policies  and guidelines that regulate how  the Fund will manage its  financial
8.2 
risks  on  a  day-to-day  basis  including  liquidity,  asset-liability,  market  and  credit  risk  management
(including the debt instruments  extended by the  Fund),  the Fund shall notify the Lender and the Trustee
if and  to the  extent that  such policies and guidelines contradict the  terms of Sections 5.1,  5.2,  5.9  and/or
5.10  of this  Loan Agreement.  The parties hereto  shall  discuss  in  good faith  to amend  Sections  5.1,  5.2,
5.9 and/or  5.10  of this Loan  Agreement  as necessary  to  reflect the  adopted policies  and guidelines,  and
such amendment  to be mutually agreed  by the parties.

No failure  or delay  in exercising  any right,  power or  remedy under this Loan  Agreement  shall
8.3 
impair such right, power or remedy or operate, or be  construed, as a waiver or variation of it  or preclude
its exercise  at any subsequent  time, and no single or partial  exercise of any right, power or remedy  shall
preclude any other or further exercises  thereof or the  exercise  of any other right, power or remedy.

8.4 
unless expressly  so stated in  a notice by  the party waiving such a right to the  other parties.

None of the parties shall be deemed to have  waived any of its rights under this  Loan Agreement,

-9-

8.5 
This Loan  Agreement  shall  be binding upon  and enure  to  the benefit  of the Fund,  the  Trustee
and the  Lender  and  its or  any  subsequent  successors  or  assignees;  provided  that,  any party to  this  Loan
Agreement  may not  assign, transfer, novate  or dispose of any of its rights or obligations  under the Loan
Agreement  without  the prior written  consent of the other parties to  the  Loan Agreement  (such consent
not to  be unreasonably  withheld or delayed).

8.6 

Notwithstanding  Section  8.5  above:

(a) 

as set forth  in paragraph 5.3  of the Standard Provisions, the Trustee  may assign, transfer
or novate  any of its rights or  obligations  under  this  Loan  Agreement  to  a successor  trustee of the Fund
upon the Board's appointment  of such trustee, and the Fund and the Lender agree to  carry out necessary
actions, if any, to effect  such assignment,  transfer or novation; and

(b) 

if the  Bank's role as the interim  trustee  of the Trust  Fund  shall be  terminated  pursuant
to the terms  of the  GCF  Trust  Fund  Agreement:  (i) the Trustee  may assign,  transfer or  novate any of its
rights  or  obligations  under  this  Loan Agreement  to  a  successor  as  directed by  the  Secretariat;  and  (ii)
the Fund and the  Lender agree to carry out necessary actions,  if any, to effect  such assignment,  transfer
or  novation.  The  Fund  further agrees  to  take all  necessary  actions  to  appoint  such  successor  without
undue  delay.  If:  (i)  the  Fund  fails  to  appoint  a  successor;  or  (ii)  the successor  fails  to  agree  to such
assignment,  transfer  or novation,  in both  cases  within  six (6)  months of termination  of the  Bank's role
as the interim  trustee of the Trust Fund, then  the Trustee,  the Fund and the Lender  shall promptly agree
to any other arrangement with a view  to winding up the Trustee's  affairs  in an expeditious manner while
avoiding discontinuity  in the  operations  under this Loan  Agreement.

Any  provision  of this  Loan  Agreement  which  is prohibited,  invalid  or  unenforceable  in  any
8.7 
jurisdiction  shall,  as  to such jurisdiction,  be ineffective  to the  extent  of such  prohibition,  invalidity  or
unenforceability  without  invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof,  and  any  such  prohibition,
invalidity  or  unenforceability  in  any  jurisdiction  shall  not  invalidate  or  render  unenforceable  such
provision in  any other jurisdiction.

This  Loan  Agreement  may be executed  in  counterparts,  each  of which  is  an original  and  all of

8.8 
which together  shall be deemed to constitute  one and  the same instrument.

8.9 
If the Board amended  or  adopted  any Applicable  Policies, the  Fund shall notify the Lender and
the  Trustee  if and to the extent  that  such amended  or  adopted  Applicable  Policies  contradict  with the
terms  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  parties  hereto  shall  discuss  in  good  faith  to  amend  the  Loan
Agreement as necessary,  and such  amendments  to the Loan  Agreement  are to be mutually agreed by the
parties.  For  the avoidance  of doubt,  to the  extent  that any  Applicable  Policies  amended  or  adopted  by
the Board relate in any way to the functions of the Trustee performed or to be performed  under this Loan
Agreement,  the  Trustee  shall not be  bound by any such  amended  or  adopted  Applicable  Policies  in  the
absence of the agreement  of the Trustee.

ARTICLE 9  - EFFECTIVENESS AND  TERMINATION

The  signature  of the  Cushion  Contribution  Agreement  by  all  parties  shall  be  the  condition

9.1 
precedent  to the execution  of this Loan Agreement,  as specified  in Annex  II  (Conditions  Precedent).

This Loan Agreement  shall come into effect upon (i)  signature  by the parties and (ii) submission
9.2 
of a written notification  from the  Secretariat to the Lender and the Trustee  that the Board has  confirmed
the terms  of this  Loan Agreement.

-10-

9.3 
If this  Loan  Agreement  shall  not  have  come  into  effect  within  three  hundred  and  sixty (360)
days  after the date  of this  Loan  Agreement,  any  party may  give a written  notice  to  the other parties  that
this  Loan  Agreement  shall be deemed  never to  have been  signed  by any of the  parties,  without need  of
any further writing or notice.

9.4 
If this  Loan Agreement  has come into effect,  this Loan  Agreement  and all rights  and obligations
of the  parties hereunder  shall  terminate  upon  the full payment,  or write off in  accordance  with  Section
5.2,  of all amounts due and payable under this Loan Agreement  and the completion  of the reimbursement
of France's  Cushion in  accordance  with  Section  5.2(ii).

ARTICLE  10  - ENFORCEABILITY;  ARBITRATION

The rights  and obligations of the Fund, the  Trustee  and  the Lender under  this  Loan  Agreement
10.1 
shall  be  valid  and  enforceable  in  accordance  with  their terms  notwithstanding  the  law  of any state  or
political  subdivision  thereof  to  the  contrary.  Neither  the  Fund,  the  Trustee  nor  the  Lender  shall  be
entitled  in  any  proceeding  under  this  Article  to  assert  any  claim  that  any  provision  of  this  Loan
Agreement  is invalid  or  unenforceable  because  of any  provision  of the  Articles  of Agreement  of the
Bank.

10.2 
The terms  and  conditions of the  GCF Trust  Fund Agreement,  as may be amended  from  time to
time  in  accordance  with  its terms,  shall  apply  to  this  Loan  Agreement.  In  case  of any  inconsistency
between  this  Loan  Agreement  and the Standard  Provisions, the terms of the  Standard Provisions  shall
prevail.

10.3 
Any  dispute,  controversy  or  claim  arising  out  of or  in connection  with  this  Loan  Agreement,
which has not been  settled amicably by  the parties,  may be submitted  to  arbitration  in  accordance  with
the  Rules  of Arbitration  of the International  Chamber  of Commerce  in  effect  on  the  date of this  Loan
Agreement,  and the  following provisions:

the place of arbitration shall be Paris,  France;  and

the language  of the arbitral proceedings  shall be English.

The award  of the Arbitral  Tribunal  shall be  final  and binding on the  parties  and enforceable  in

10.4 
any court of competent jurisdiction.  The parties shall  carry out the  award  without delay.

The  obligations  of the  Trustee  under  this  Loan  Agreement  are  not  the  obligations  of  any

10.5 
government  or member  of the Bank.

10.6  Nothing  in  this  Loan  Agreement  shall  operate  as  or  be  construed  to  constitute  a  waiver,
renunciation  or any other modification  of any privilege  or immunity of:

the Bank under its Articles  of Agreement  or under any applicable  law; or

the  Fund  under  any  privilege  or  immunity  that  it  may  have  under  its  Governing

Instrument or under any applicable  law, treaty or binding international agreement  or instrument.
