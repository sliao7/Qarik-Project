1. 

The following  table sets  forth the  Principal Payment  Dates of the Loan  and the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds of the  Loan have been fully  withdrawn as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment
Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

On  each January  15  and  July  15

2. 

If the proceeds  of the  Loan have  not been fully withdrawn  as of the first  Principal  Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  shall  be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the  extent that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as of the  first
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as
of such date  in accordance  with  paragraph  I of this Schedule.

Any amount  withdrawn  after  the  first Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment Date  falling  after the  date of such  withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying the  amount  of each such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted, as  necessary, to  deduct any  amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts

-14-

payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding
on the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date following  the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the  Bank adopts a due date  billing system  under which  invoices  are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer apply to  any withdrawals  made after the  adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date  occurring during the Conversion  Period,  shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall apply  separately to the  amount denominated  in each  Loan
Currency,  so as  to produce a separate  amortization  schedule  for  each  such  amount.
