LOAN NUMBER 7976-PE 

 
LOAN AGREEMENT 
 

Agreement  dated  December  21,  2010,  entered  into  between  REPUBLIC  OF 
PERU  (“Borrower”)  and  INTERNATIONAL  BANK  FOR  RECONSTRUCTION  AND 
DEVELOPMENT  (“Bank”)  for  the  purpose  of  providing  financing  in  support  of  the 
Program  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement).    The  Bank  has  decided  to 
provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions which the Borrower has 
already taken under the Program and which are described in Section I.A of Schedule 1 to 
this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower’s maintenance of an appropriate macro-economic 
policy framework.  The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as follows: 

 
ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 

 
1.01.  The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement) 

constitute an integral part of this Agreement. 

 
1.02.  Unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  the  capitalized  terms  used  in  this 
Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions  or in 
the Appendix to this Agreement. 

 
ARTICLE II — LOAN 
 
2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or 
referred  to  in  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of  one  hundred  million  Dollars 
($100,000,000), as such amount  may be converted from time to time through a 
Currency  Conversion  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section  2.07  of  this 
Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program 
in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. The Borrower’s 
Director  of  Public  Indebtedness,  or  any  person  designated  in  writing,  is 
designated as the representative of the Borrower for the purposes of taking any 
action required or permitted to be taken under the provisions of this Section and 
Article II of the General Conditions.  

 
2.03.  The  Front-end  Fee  payable  by  the  Borrower  shall  be  equal  to  one  half  of  one 
percent (0.50%). The Borrower shall pay the Front-end Fee not later than sixty 
days after the Effective Date. 

 
2.04. 

If, at the Borrower’s request and on such terms and conditions as the Bank may 
agree,  the  Closing  Date  is  extended,  the  fee  payable  by  the  Borrower  for  each 
extension of the Closing Date shall be at the rate of  one quarter of one percent 
(0.25%).    If  the  Borrower  elects  to  capitalize  the  fee  from  the  Loan,  the  Bank 

shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to 
itself such amounts required to pay such fee.  If the Borrower elects to pay the 
fee from its own resources, the Borrower shall pay such fee not later than sixty 
days after the date of the notice given by the Bank to the Borrower confirming 
the extension of the Closing Date. 

 
2.05.   The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate 
equal  to  the  Reference  Rate  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Variable  Spread; 
provided, that upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of 
the Loan, the interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on 
such  amount  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of 
Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any 
amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-
payment  continues  for  a  period  of  thirty  days,  then  the  interest  payable  by  the 
Borrower  shall  instead  be  calculated  as  provided  in  Section  3.02  (e)  of  the 
General Conditions. 

 
2.06.  The Payment Dates are April 15 and October 15 in each year. 
 
2.07. 

(a) 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  paragraph  (b)  of  this  Section,  the 
principal  amount  of  the  Loan  shall  be  repaid  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of Schedule 2 to this Agreement. 

 
 

(b) 

 
2.08. 

(a) 

The Borrower may, at the time of requesting a Withdrawal, also request 
repayment  provisions  different  from  those  set  out  in Schedule  2  to  this 
Agreement for such Withdrawal, provided that: (i) the average maturity 
of such Withdrawal does not exceed 18 years from the Withdrawal Date 
and the final maturity of such Withdrawal does not exceed 30 years from 
the  Withdrawal  Date  (or  such  other  average  maturity  and/or  final 
maturity as may be generally applicable to loans made by the Bank to the 
Borrower  at  the  time  of  such  agreement);  and  (ii)  such  repayment 
provisions have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank prior to 
the Withdrawal Date of such Withdrawal. 

The Borrower may at any time request any of the following Conversions 
of the terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: 
(i) a change of the Loan Currency of all or any portion of the principal 
amount  of  the  Loan,  withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved 
Currency; (ii) a change of the interest rate basis applicable to all or any 
portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding 
from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice versa, or from a Variable 
Rate  based  on  a  Variable  Spread  to  a  Variable  Rate  based  on  a  Fixed 
Rate; and (iii) the setting of limits on the Variable Rate applicable to all 
or  any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and 

- 2 - 
 

 

- 3 - 
 

outstanding by the establishment of an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate 
Collar on the Variable Rate. 

Any conversion requested pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section that 
is accepted by the Bank shall be considered a “Conversion”, as defined 
in the General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the 
provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion 
Guidelines.  

2.09.  At any time prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower may, by notice to the Bank, 
refund any amount of the Withdrawn Balance for the purpose of re-crediting such 
amount  to  the  Loan  Account  for  further  withdrawals.    Upon  such  refund,  the 
repayment schedule shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis, on terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Bank. 

 
2.10.  Without  limitation  upon  the  provisions  of  the  General  Conditions  regarding 
Cooperation and Consultation (Originally Section 5.10 and renumbered as 5.08 
pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  Section  II  of  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement),  the 
Borrower  shall  promptly  furnish  to  the  Bank  such  information  relating  to  the 
provisions  of  this  Article  II  as  the  Bank  may,  from  time  to  time,  reasonably 
request. 

 
ARTICLE III — PROGRAM 

 
3.01.  The  Borrower,  through  its  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  declares  its 
commitment  to  the  Program,  and  through  the  Implementing  Agencies,  to  its 
implementation.    To  this  end,  and  further  to  Section  5.08  of  the  General 
Conditions: 

 

 

the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  shall  from  time  to  time,  at  the  request  of 
either party, exchange views on the progress achieved in carrying out the 
Program; 

prior to each such exchange of views, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank  for  its  review  and  comment  a  report  on  the  progress  achieved  in 
carrying  out  the  Program,  in  such  detail  as  the  Bank  shall  reasonably 
request; and 

without limitation  upon the  provisions  of  paragraphs  (a)  and (b)  of  this 
Section,  the  Borrower  shall  promptly  inform  the  Bank  of  any  situation 
that  would  have  the  effect  of  materially  reversing  the  objectives  of  the 
Program  or  any  action  taken  under  the  Program  including  any  action 
specified in Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV — REMEDIES OF THE BANK 
 
4.01.  The  Additional  Event  of  Suspension  consists  of  the  following,  namely,  that

significant part of it, will be carried out. 
 

ARTICLE V — EFFECTIVENESS; TERMINATION 

 
5.01.  The Additional Condition of Effectiveness consists of the following, namely, that

Borrower’s Director of Public Indebtedness may, by him or herself, represent the 
 
Borrower  to  sign  amendments  to  this  Agreement  which  are  considered  of  an 
 
administrative  and  non-financial  nature.    The  signing  by  such  Director  of  an 
 
amendment  shall  constitute  a  representation  by  the  Borrower  that  any  such 
 
 
amendment is considered to be administrative and non-financial in nature.

SCHEDULE 1 
 
Program Actions; Availability of Loan Proceeds 
 
Actions under the Program 

The  actions  taken  by  the  Borrower  to  enhance  its  capacity  to  implement  a 
disaster  risk  management  program  for  adverse  natural  events  consist  of  the 
following:  

(ii) 

 
(iii) 

(iv) 

the  Borrower,  through  MEF,  has  designed  and  adopted  a  budgetary 
strategic  program  on  disaster  vulnerability  reduction  and  emergency 
response  under  a  results-based  budgeting  framework,  as  evidenced  by 
Decreto de Urgencia No. 024-2010 of March 31, 2010. 

the  Borrower,  through  MINSA,  has  adopted  a  national  policy  for 
ensuring  safe  hospitals  in  case  of    disasters,  as  evidenced  by  Decreto 
Supremo No. 009-2010-SA of April 24, 2010. 

the  Borrower,  through  SUNASS,  has  issued  regulations  concerning  the 
quality of the provision of sanitation services, including measures to be 
adopted  in  emergency  situations,  as  evidenced  by  Resolución  del 
Consejo Directivo No. 011-2007-SUNASS-CD of February 2, 2007. 

 

 

The  Borrower,  through  its  Parliament,  has  enacted  the  public  sector 
borrowing law (Ley General del Sistema de Endeudamiento), including a 
special  chapter  on  the  attention  to  disasters  and  emergency  situations, 
allowing  MEF  to  start  building  the  Borrower’s  financial  protection 
mechanism  against  disaster,  as  evidenced  by  Law  29290  of  December 
10, 2008. 

 

Availability of Loan Proceeds 

General.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance 
with the provisions of this Section and such additional instructions as the Bank 
may specify by notice to the Borrower.

Payment  of  Front-end  Fee.    No  withdrawal  shall  be  made  from  the  Loan 
Account until the Bank has received payment in full of the Front-end Fee. 

Payment  of Fee Pursuant  to  Section  2.04  of  this  Agreement.    If  the  Closing 
Date  is  extended  pursuant to  Section  2.04  of  this  Agreement  and  the  Borrower 
elects  to  finance  from  its  own  resources  the  fee  set  forth  in  said  Section,  no 
withdrawal  shall  be  made  from  the  Loan  Account  until  the  Bank  has  received 
payment in full of such fee. 

Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds.   

No withdrawal shall be made of the Tranche unless the Bank is satisfied, based 
on  evidence  satisfactory  to  it,  that  a  national  State  of  Emergency  (Estado  de 
Emergencia)  exists  in  the  Borrower’s  territory  as  a  result  of  a  natural  disaster 
which  has  been  declared  by  the  Borrower,  through  a  Decreto  Supremo 
(Presidential Decree), all in accordance with the Borrower’s legislation. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the receipt by the Bank of 
a request for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, the Bank determines that a 
review of the Borrower’s progress in carrying out the Program is warranted, the 
Bank shall give notice to the Borrower to that effect.  Upon the giving of such 
notice, no withdrawals shall be made of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance unless 
and until the Bank has notified the Borrower of its satisfaction, after an exchange 
of  views  as  described  in  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of  said  Section  3.01,  with  the 
progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program. 

Deposits of Loan Amounts.  Except as the Bank may otherwise agree:   
 
all  withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  shall  be  deposited  by  the  Bank  into  an 
account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank; and 
 
the Borrower shall ensure that upon each deposit of an amount of the Loan into 
this  account,  an  equivalent  amount  is  accounted  for  in  the  Borrower’s  budget 
management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank and consistent with the 
Borrower’s public accounting and budgeting regulations. 

 

Audit.  Upon the Bank’s request, the Borrower shall: 

1. 

 
2. 

 
3. 

have the account designated by the Borrower pursuant to Section F.1 of 
this Section II audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, in 
accordance with consistently applied auditing standards acceptable to the 
Bank.  The  appointment  conditions  of  said  auditors  shall  be  mutually 
agreed between the Borrower and the Bank; 

furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case no later than six 
months  after  the  date  of  the  Bank’s  request  for  such  audit,  a  certified 
copy of the report of such audit, of such scope and in such detail as the 
Bank shall reasonably request; and 

furnish  to  the  Bank  such  other  information  concerning  the  account  and 
its audit as the Bank shall reasonably request. 

Excluded  Expenditures.    The  Borrower  undertakes  that  the  proceeds  of  the 
Loan shall not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines 
at  any  time  that  an  amount  of  the  Loan  was  used  to  make  a  payment  for  an 
Excluded Expenditure, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, 
refund  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  such  payment  to  the  Bank.  Amounts 
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. 

Closing Date.  The Closing Date is December 9, 2013

SCHEDULE 2 
 
Amortization Schedule

2.  

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the 
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency 
Conversion applies.

Installment Share 
(Expressed as a Percentage) 
44.44% 
37.04% 
18.52% 

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment  Date, the principal amount  of  the  Loan repayable  by  the  Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

 
(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such 
withdrawal  in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original 
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such 
date[, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies.  

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 

 

 
3. 

(a) 

- 10 - 
 

withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for 
each such amount.
