The  term  “Financial  Statements”  and  its  definition  as  set  forth  in  the 
Appendix are deleted in their entirety. 

The term “Fixed Spread” is modified to read as follows: 

“Fixed Spread” means, for each Withdrawal, the Bank’s fixed spread for 
the Loan Currency of the Withdrawal in effect at 12:01 a.m. Washington, 
D.C.  time,  on  the  Withdrawal  Date;  provided,  that:  (a)  for  purposes  of 
determining the Default Interest Rate, pursuant to Section 3.02 (d), that is 
applicable  to  an    amount  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  on  which 
interest is payable at a Fixed Rate, the “Fixed Spread” means the Bank’s 
fixed spread in effect at 12:01 a.m. Washington, D.C. time, one calendar 
day  prior  to  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  for  the  Currency  of 
denomination  of  such  amount;  (b)  for  purposes  of  fixing  the  Variable 
Spread pursuant to Section 4.02, “Fixed Spread” means the Bank’s fixed 
spread  for the  Loan  Currency  in  effect at 12:01  a.m.  Washington,  D.C. 
time on the Conversion Date; and (c) upon a Currency Conversion of all 
or  any  amount  of  the  Unwithdrawn  Loan  Balance  pursuant  to  Section 
4.04 (a), the Fixed Spread shall be adjusted on the Execution Date in the 
manner specified in the Conversion Guidelines.  
 
The  term  “Project”  is  modified  to  read  “Program”  and  its  definition  is 
modified  to  read  as  follows  (and  all  references  to  “Project”  throughout 
these General Conditions are deemed to be references to “Program”):  

“‘Program’  means  the  program  referred  to  in  the  Loan  Agreement  in 
support of which the Loan is made.”

The term “Variable Spread” is modified to read as follows: 

“Variable Spread” means, for each Withdrawal and each Interest Period: 
(1) the Bank’s standard variable spread for Loans in effect at 12:01 a.m. 
Washington, D.C. time, on the Withdrawal Date; (2) minus (or plus) the 
weighted  average  margin,  for  the  Interest  Period,  below  (or  above) 
LIBOR, or other reference rates, for six-month deposits, in respect of the 
Bank’s outstanding borrowings or portions thereof allocated by it to fund 
loans  that  carry  interest  at  a  rate  based  on  the  Variable  Spread;  as 
reasonably  determined  by  the  Bank  and  expressed  as  a  percentage  per 
annum.  In the case of a Loan denominated in more than one Currency, 
“Variable Spread” applies separately to each of such Currencies.
