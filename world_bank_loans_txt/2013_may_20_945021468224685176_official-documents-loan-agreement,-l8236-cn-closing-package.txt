Date ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  fully withdrawn  as  of
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by
multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be
adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts  referred  to in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,

To  the  extent  that  any proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance
as of such  date in accordance  with paragraph  1 of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment Date falling  after the date  of such  withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the  Bank  by multiplying the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is the  original  Installment  Share specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts

applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment Date  shall,  for the purposes  solely  of calculating  the principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of
withdrawal  and  shall be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date commencing
with the second Principal  Payment  Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued
on  or after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of
such  billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to  the Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the exchange  rate that reflects  the amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the
Conversion Guidelines,  the exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan  Currency, so  as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such amount.
