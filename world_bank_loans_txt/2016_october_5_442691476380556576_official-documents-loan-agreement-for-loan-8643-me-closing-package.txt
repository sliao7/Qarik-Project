The  following  table  sets  forth  the Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal  Payment Date shall be determined by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any amounts  referred  to
in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to which a  Currency  Conversion applies.

Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1 of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of such
withdrawal  in amounts determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1 of this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which a Currency
Conversion applies.

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within two calendar  months prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date of withdrawal  and shall  be repayable on  each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are  issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
such
of 
sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the
adoption  of such  billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on any Principal  Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion by  either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to  the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in more  than one Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the amount denominated
in each Loan  Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each
such  amount.
