All  such  deposits  shall  be  withdrawn  by  the Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under
the  respective  eligible  Categories,  and  in  the  respective  equivalent amounts,  as shall  have
been justified  by  said  documents  and  other  evidence.

Loan  Account  pursuant  to the  provisions  of Section  6.02  of the  General  Conditions;  or

Bank pursuant to  Section  5.02  of the General  Conditions with  respect to the Project,  shall
equal  the  equivalent  of twice  the  amount  of the Authorized  Allocation.

the Bank shall  specify  by notice to the  Borrower.  Such further  'ithdrawals  shall  be made
only  after  and  to the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have been  satisfied  that  all  such amounts

in  making payments  for  eligible  expenditures.

Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional  evidence  as the Bank may request;  or (B)  deposit  into the  Special  Account  (or,
if the  Bank shall  so request,  refund  to the  Bank)  an  amount  equal  to the  amount  of such
payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the  Bank  into the  Special  Account  shall be  made
until the Borrower has provided  such  evidence or made  such deposit or refund,  as the case
may  be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall,  promptly  upon notice from  the Bank, refund  to the Bank
such  outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or

any  portion  of the  funds  on  deposit  in  the  Special  Account.

Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of this  Agreement,  including the
General  Conditions.
