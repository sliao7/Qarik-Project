by the Borrower,  exclusive  of any such  expenditures  financed  by  any other  financier  or by
the  Bank  or  the  Association  under  any  other  loan,  credit  or  grant,  the  Borrower  shall,

The following  table  sets forth the  Principal  Payment Dates  of the  Loan and the  percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds of the Loan  have  been fully withdrawn  as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the first Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment
Share  for each  Principal Payment Date, such repayable  amount to be adjusted,  as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date shall  be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as of the  first
Principal  Payment Date, the  Borrower  shall repay the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance as
of such date  in  accordance  with paragraph  I  of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling after the  date  of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount of each  such withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on or  after  such
date,  such  amounts repayable  to  be adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn within two calendar months  prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and outstanding
on the second  Principal  Payment  Date following  the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the Bank adopts  a due date  billing system  under which  invoices  are  issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-

- 17-

paragraph shall  no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after the adoption of such
billing  system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a Currency
Conversion  of all or any portion of the  Withdrawn Loan  Balance to an  Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,  shall  be determined by the  Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate component  of the  Screen Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to  the amount denominated  in each Loan
Currency,  so  as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
