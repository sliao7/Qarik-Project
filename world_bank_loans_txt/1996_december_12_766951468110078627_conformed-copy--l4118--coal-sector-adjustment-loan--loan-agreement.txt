Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn amount of the Loan or any part thereof.

     Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be December 31, 1997 or such
later date as the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify
the Borrower of such later date.

     Section 2.04. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment

               Interest Period, for value the Interest Payment Date
               occurring on or next preceding the first day of such
               Interest Period), as reasonably determined by the
               Bank and expressed as a percentage per annum.

         (iv)  "LIBOR Total Spread" means, for each Interest Period:

               plus) the weighted average margin, for such Interest
               Period, below (or above) the London Interbank offered

interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as provided in said
Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest
rates applicable to the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’

notice to the Borrower of the new basis. The basis shall become
