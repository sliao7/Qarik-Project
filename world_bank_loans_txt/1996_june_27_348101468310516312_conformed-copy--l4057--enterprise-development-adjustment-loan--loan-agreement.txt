Section I.  Actions to Be Implemented Pursuant to Paragraph 4 (a) of
            Schedule 1 to This Agreement

1.    Liberalization of the Trade and Price Regime

      The Borrower has taken the following steps to establish and
maintain a properly competitive environment:

      (a)   elimination of all export duties;

      (b)   removal of indicative prices on all exports with the
exception of those covered by voluntary export restraints, anti-dumping
investigations, and international contingent agreements;

      (c)   rescission of the Special Export Regime;

certification for foreign-produced goods as applied at the import level,
and replacement thereof by a nondiscrimatory system of random checks at

      (f)   elimination of all domestic price controls on artificial
monopolies, caps on trade mark-ups and profit margins on the correspond-
ing goods; and

      (g)   issuance of normative acts limiting price regulation to a
specific list of goods and services, and limitation of the functions of
the State Price Inspection for Control of Prices to monitoring only
those goods and services on said list.

2.    Privatization

      (a)   In the period starting with January 1, 1995, the Borrower
has privatized at least 3,500 medium/large-scale state owned enterprises,
by divesting at least seventy percent (70%) of the equity of such

(30%) shall be enterprises that as of January 1, 1995, were classified by

      (b)   The Borrower has implemented a methodology for privatization
of agro-industrial enterprises which: (i) has shortened the periods for
the corporatization and share subscription processes to a period
approximating the corresponding periods achieved for analogous enterprises
in other sectors; and (ii) ensures that shares in these enterprises

of the capital markets by:

shareholders to private and independent registrars, to the extent that
the development of the system of private independent registrars described
in the letter referred to in paragraph A of the Preamble to this Agreement
may so permit.  For purposes of this provision, a registrar shall be
considered "private and independent" when neither the Government nor any
issuer controls more than 20 percent of the registrar’s equity each;

      (b)   adoption of the enactments governing the operation of the
capital markets, described in the letter referred to in Recital (A) in
the Preamble to this Agreement; and

                               Special Account

1.    For the purposes of this Schedule:

      (a)   the term "eligible Category" means Category (1) set forth in
the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

      (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for the
Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of Portion A allocated
to the eligible Category in accordance with the provisions of Schedule
1 to this Agreement; and

      (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent

the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.

2.    Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the
Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account

shall be made as follows:

      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the
Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate
amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the
Loan Account and deposit into the  Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.

      (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the  Special Account, the Borrower
                  shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into
                  the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall
                  specify.

           (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                  Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and
                  other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of
                  this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect
                  of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of
                  each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                  Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
                  into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                  shall have requested and as shall have been shown by
                  said documents and other evidence to have been paid
                  out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.
                  All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from
                  the Loan Account under the eligible Category, and in
                  the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been
                  justified by said documents and other evidence.

4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account,
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request,
furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such
payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special
Account:

      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

      (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,
within the period of time specified in Section 3.03 (b) (ii) of this
Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the Bank
pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and
accounts for the Special Account;

      (c)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower
to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

      (d)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Category, minus the total amount of all outstanding special
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the
General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the’
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn
amount of Portion A allocated to the eligible Category shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in
making payments for eligible expenditures.

6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or

in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or
(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof
not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or
refund, as the case may be.

      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank
all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant
provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
