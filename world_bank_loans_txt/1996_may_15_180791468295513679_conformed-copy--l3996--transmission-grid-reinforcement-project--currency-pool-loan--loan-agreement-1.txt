          (v) The term "current net value of the Borrower’s fixed assets
              in operation" means the total gross value of the Borrower’s

              depreciation, as valued from time to time in accordance with
              sound and consistently maintained methods of valuation
              satisfactory to the Bank.

         (vi) The term "debt" means any indebtedness of the Borrower

              necessary to value, in terms of the currency of the
              Guarantor, debt payable in another currency, such valuation
              shall be made on the basis of the prevailing market rate of
              exchange at which such other currency is, at the time of
              such valuation, obtainable for the purposes of servicing
              such debt, or, in the absence of such rate, on the basis of
              a rate of exchange acceptable to the Bank.

     (e)    For the purpose of calculating the rate of return specified
in paragraph (a) of this Section, the Borrower shall carry out, not later

in operation, in accordance with sound and consistently applied methods
of valuation, acceptable to the Bank.

     Section 5.03. (a)Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the
Borrower shall not incur any debt unless a reasonable forecast of the
revenues and expenditures of the Borrower shows that the estimated net
revenues of the Borrower (i) during each Fiscal Year up to and including
Fiscal Year 1999, shall be at least equal to the estimated debt service
requirements of the Borrower in such year on all debt of the Borrower,
including the debt to be incurred; (ii) and for each Fiscal Year
thereafter shall be at least one and three-tenths (1.3) times said
estimated debt service requirements of the Borrower in such year.

          (b) For the purposes of this Section:

          (i) The term "debt" means any indebtedness of the Borrower
              maturing by its terms more than one (1) year after the

              deemed to be incurred: (A) under a loan contract or

              agreement or other instrument providing for such debt or
              for the modification of its terms of payment on the date
              of such contract, agreement or instrument; and (B) under
              a guarantee agreement, on the date the agreement providing
              for such guarantee has been entered into.

         (ii) The term "net revenues" means the difference between: (A)
              the sum of revenues from all sources related to operations
              and net non-operating income; and (B) the sum of all
              expenses related to operations including administration,
              adequate maintenance and  taxes, but excluding provision
              for depreciation, other non-cash operating charges and
              interest and other charges on debt.

        (iii) The term "net non-operating income" means the difference
              between: (A) revenues from all sources other than those
              related to operations; and (B) expenses, including taxes,
              incurred in the generation of revenues in Sub-section
              (A) above.

         (iv) The term  "debt service requirements" means the aggregate
              amount of repayments (including sinking fund payments, if
              any,) of, and interest and other charges on, debt.

          (v) The term "reasonable forecast" means a forecast prepared
              by the Borrower not earlier than twelve (12) months prior
              to the incurrence of the debt in question, which both the
              Bank and the Borrower accept as reasonable and as to which
              the Bank has notified the Borrower of its acceptability,
              provided that no event has occurred since such notification
              which has, or may reasonably be expected in the future to
              have, a material adverse effect on the financial condition
              or future operating results of the Borrower.

         (vi) Whenever for the purposes of this Section it shall be
              necessary to value, in terms of the currency of the
              Guarantor, debt payable in another currency, such valuation
              shall be made on the basis of the prevailing market rate of
              exchange at which such other currency is, at the time of
              such valuation, obtainable for the purposes of servicing
              such debt, or, in the absence of such rate, on the basis of
              a rate of exchange acceptable to the Bank.

     Section 5.04. The Borrower shall prepare, in accordance with
guidelines satisfactory to the Bank, and furnish to the Bank for
information, not later than December 31 in each Fiscal Year, its
projections in respect of its capital expenditures and of the demand for
power supplied by it, and its financial projections, all for the next
following five (5) Fiscal Years.

                             SCHEDULE 6

                           Special Account

1.    For the purposes of this Schedule:

      (a)   The term "Eligible Categories" means Categories 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this
Agreement;

      (b)   The term "Eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect
of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and
to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time
to the Eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1

one million dollars ($1,000,000) to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this
Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to two
hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) until the aggregate amount of
withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of
the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of five
million dollars ($5,000,000).

2.    Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for
Eligible Expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the
Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account
shall be made as follows:

      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the
Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate
amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the
Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.

      (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower
                  shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into
                  the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall
                  specify.

           (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                  Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and
                  other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this
                  Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of which
                  replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such
                  request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
                  withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the
                  Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have
                  requested and as shall have been shown by said documents
                  and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special
                  Account for Eligible Expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account
under the respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.

4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish
to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.

5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the
Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special
Account:

      (a)   If, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan
Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

      (b)   If the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,
within the period of time specified in Section 5.01 (b) (ii) of this
Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the Bank
pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and
accounts for the Special Account;

      (c)   If, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of
its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to
make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

      (d)   Once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the
General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent
of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn
amount of the Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in

making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment
out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an
amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was
not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence
as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.
Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into
the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank
all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant
provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
