percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan payable  on  each  Principal  Payment

the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by
multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as of the first  Principal Payment  Date;  by (b)
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be

To the  extent  that any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been withdrawn  as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn Loan  Balance
as of such  date in accordance  with paragraph  1 of this Schedule.
Any amount  withdrawn  after  the first  Principal  Payment Date  shall  be repaid  on
each  Principal Payment  Date falling  after  the date of such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the Bank by  multiplying  the amount  of each  such withdrawal  by a

table  in paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling on  or after  such
date, such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted, as necessary,  to deduct any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the purposes  solely of calculating the  principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and

-15-

withdrawal and shall  be repayable  on  each Principal  Payment  Date commencing
with the second Principal Payment  Date following the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if at any
time  the Bank  adopts  a due  date billing  system under which  invoices  are  issued
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-
paragraph  shall no  longer apply  to  any  withdrawals  made after  the adoption  of
such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon a  Currency
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the amount  so  converted  in the  Approved  Currency  that is  repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,  shall be determined  by
the  Bank by  multiplying such  amount in its currency  of denomination  immediately prior
to the Conversion by  either:  (i) the exchange  rate that  reflects the amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the
Conversion  Guidelines, the  exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan Currency,  so as to produce a separate amortization  schedule  for each such amount.
