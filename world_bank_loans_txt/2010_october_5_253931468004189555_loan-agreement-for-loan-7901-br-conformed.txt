and adjust as necessary, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. 
 
The  budget  code  numbers  indicated  in  Schedule  4  to  this  Agreement  shall 
conform  to  the  Borrower’s  budget  law.  The  Borrower  and  the  Bank  agree  that 
such  budget  code  numbers  may  change  under  the  Borrower’s  budget  law 
provided,  however,  that  there  is  no  change  in  the  corresponding  Programs 
described in Schedule 4 of this Agreement and in the underlying activities to be 
financed by the Bank under such Programs. 

If, at any time, the Bank determines that any portion of the Loan Proceeds was 
used for  items  improperly procured  in  violation  of  Section  III  to  this  Schedule, 
was  not  used  for  Eligible  Expenditures  or,  in  case  of  the  Eligible  Expenditure 
Programs under Part 1(a) of the Project, was not supported by evidence of actual 
spending  by  the  Borrower  under  said  Eligible  Expenditure  Programs  and/or  by 
evidence  of  satisfaction  of  other  criteria  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  or  in  the 
Project  Operational  Manual,  the  Borrower  shall  promptly  refund  any  such 
portion to the Bank as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  

The Borrower shall: (a) make available a portion of the proceeds of the Loan, on 
a grant  basis  (the  Result-based  Grant),  to  the  relevant  Eligible  Beneficiary 
pursuant to the terms of an agreement (the Result-based Grant Agreement) to be 
entered  into  between  the  Borrower  and  the  relevant  Eligible  Beneficiary,  on 
terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  the  Bank,  which  terms  shall  have  been 
approved by the Bank; and (b) (i) exercise its rights and carry out its obligations 
under  each  Result-based  Grant  Agreement  in  such  manner  as  to  protect  the 
interests  of  the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  and  to  accomplish  the  purposes  of  the 
Loan;  and  (ii)  except  as  the  Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  not  assign,  amend, 
abrogate, terminate, waive or fail to enforce any Result-based Grant Agreement 
or any provision thereof.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Part A of this Section, no withdrawal shall be 
made: 

for payments made prior to the date of this Agreement; 
 
for  payments  made  under  Category  (1)  unless:  (i)  the  relevant  Project 
Reports,  as  referred  to  in  Section.  I.A.(c)  of  this  Schedule,  have  been 
submitted to, and found satisfactory by, the Bank, in accordance with the 
provisions  of  the  Project  Operational  Manual  and  the  additional 
instructions  referred  to  in  Section  IV.A.1  of  this  Schedule;  and  (ii)  all 
other conditions referred to in the Project Operational Manual and in the 
additional  instructions  referred  to  in  Section  IV.A.1  of  this  Schedule 
(including,  when  applicable,  compliance  with  the  Disbursement-Linked 
Indicators  (for  the  respective  semester)  as  referred  to  in  Schedule  5  to 
this Agreement and compliance with the 70% Rule Indicator) have been 
met by the Borrower in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank. 

If the Bank has: 
 
(a) 

not  received  evidence  of  full  compliance  with  the  70%  Rule  Indicator 
with  respect  to  the  second,  fourth,  sixth  and  eighth  disbursement  under 
Category  (1)  (as  referred  to  in  the  Project  Operational  Manual  and 
additional  instructions  referred  to  in  Section  IV.A.1  of  this  Schedule), 
then  the  maximum  amount  of  the  corresponding  withdrawal  shall  be 
proportional to the degree of execution of the Borrower’s EEP, as further 
detailed in the additional instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 of this 
Schedule; 

not  received  evidence  of  full  compliance  with  the  DLIs  referred  to  in 
Schedule  5  to  this  Agreement  in  respect  to  the  first  to  the  seventh 
disbursements  under  Category  (1)  (as  referred  to  in  the  Project 
Operational Manual and the additional instructions referred to in Section 
IV.A.1 of this Schedule), the Bank shall: (i) allocate a base value of $1 
million  to  each  DLI  and  deduct  said  base  value  from  the  otherwise 
disbursable  amount,  all  as  set  forth  in  said  additional  instructions;  (ii) 
request the Borrower to prepare a time-bound action plan to achieve such 
DLI  or  DLIs  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  the  Bank;  and  (iii)  when 
satisfied  that  the  DLI  or  DLIs  have  been  complied  with  and/or  such 
action  plan  has  been  implemented,  authorize  that  the  unwithdrawn 
amount  by  which  the  corresponding  disbursement  had  been  reduced  be 

19 

(c) 

carried  forward  to  the  immediately  subsequent  withdrawal,  all  as  set 
forth in said additional instructions; and 
 
received  evidence  satisfactory  to  the  Bank  that  the  Borrower  has 
accelerated  Project  implementation  by  increasing  EEP  execution  and 
achieving the DLIs earlier than expected, then the Bank  may accelerate 
disbursements, by an additional $1 million for each DLI achieved earlier 
than expected, as further detailed in the additional instructions referred to 
in Section IV.A.1 of this Schedule.  

In the event that the Bank has not approved a full withdrawal by the Borrower of 
the Loan proceeds under Category (1) (as referred to in the Project Operational 
Manual  and  the  additional  instructions  referred  to  in  Section  IV.A.1  of  this 
Schedule),  the  Bank  may,  by  notice  to  the  Borrower,  cancel  the  corresponding 
amount of the loan at the time of the eighth disbursement (as referred to in the 
Project Operational Manual and the additional instructions referred to in Section 
IV.A.1 of this Schedule).

SCHEDULE 3 
 
Amortization Schedule 
 

1. 

 

 

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the 
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency 
Conversion applies.

2.  

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment  Date, the principal amount  of  the  Loan repayable  by  the  Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

 
(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such 
withdrawal  in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original 
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 
Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 

3. 

(a) 

21 

following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for 
each such amount.
