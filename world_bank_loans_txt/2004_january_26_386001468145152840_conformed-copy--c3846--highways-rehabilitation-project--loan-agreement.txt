twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of

the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the 
Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Loan Special Account 
shall  be  made  until  the  Borrower  has  provided  such  evidence  or  made  such  deposit  or 
refund, as the case may be. 

If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  amount 
outstanding in the Loan Special Account will not be required to cover further payments 
for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund 
to the Bank such outstanding amount. 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or 

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Loan Special Account. 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6(a), (b) and (c) of this 
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the
