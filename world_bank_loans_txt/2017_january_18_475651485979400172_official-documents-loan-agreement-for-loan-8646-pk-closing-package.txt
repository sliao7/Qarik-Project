of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date

Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date shall be  determined as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment Date, the Borrower shall  repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance as
of such date  in accordance  with paragraph  1 of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after the date  of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the Bank  by multiplying  the amount of each such withdrawal  by a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is the original  Installment  Share specified in the
table  in  paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment Date  shall,  for  the purposes  solely of calculating  the principal  amounts
payable  on any Principal  Payment  Date, be  treated  as withdrawn  and  outstanding
on the second Principal  Payment  Date  following the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the Bank adopts  a  due date  billing system under which invoices  are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date occurring during the  Conversion Period, shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency payable  by  the Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange  rate component  of the Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule shall  apply separately to the amount denominated  in each  Loan
Currency,  so as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for  each  such amount.
