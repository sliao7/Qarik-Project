Payment  Date; by  (b)  the  Installment  Share for  each Principal  Payment Date, such

Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts determined  by the Bank by  multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")

Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within two  calendar  months prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as

- 18-

following the  date of withdrawal  and  shall  be repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

(b)

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing  system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall  no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption  of such  billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any  Principal Payment Date occurring  during the  Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to  the Conversion  by either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines 
the
exchange  rate  component of the  Screen  Rate.

in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines, 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated
in each  Loan  Currency,  so  as to  produce  a  separate amortization  schedule  for each
such amount.
