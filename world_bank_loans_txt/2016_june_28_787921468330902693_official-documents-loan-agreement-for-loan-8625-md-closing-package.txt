shall  be  prepared  so  as  to  ensure  economy,  efficiency,  transparency,  and  broad
consistency with the provisions  of Section  I  of the Procurement  Guidelines.

Qualification:  Qualification  criteria  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the  bidding
documents.  All  criteria so specified,  and only such specified criteria, shall be used
to  determine  whether  a  bidder  is  qualified.  Qualification  shall  be  assessed  on  a
"pass  or  fail"  basis,  and merit  points  shall  not  be used.  Such  assessment  shall be
based  entirely  upon  the bidder's  or  prospective  bidder's  capability  and resources
to effectively  perform the  contract,  taking  into  account  objective  and  measurable
factors,  including:  (i)  relevant  general  and  specific  experience,  and  satisfactory
past  performance  and  successful  completion  of  similar  contracts  over  a  given
period;  (ii)  financial  position;  and  where  relevant;  (iii)  capability  of construction

-14-

and/or  manufacturing  facilities.  Prequalification  procedures  and  documents
acceptable  to  the Bank  shall  be used  for large,  complex  and/or  specialized  works.
The  verification  of  the  information  upon  which  a  bidder  was  prequalified,
including  current  commitments,  shall  be carried  out  at the time  of contract award,
along with the  bidder's  capability  with respect to personnel  and equipment.  In the
procurement  of  goods  and  works  where  pre-qualification 
is  not  used,  the
qualification  of the  bidder  who  is  recommended  for  award  of contract  shall  be
assessed  by  post-qualification,  applying  the  qualification  criteria  stated  in  the
bidding  documents.

Cost  Estimate:  The  detailed  cost  estimates  shall  be  confidential  and  shall  not  be
disclosed to prospective  bidders.  The cost estimate  will include all taxes  including
Value  Added  Tax. No  bids  shall  be rejected  on the  basis of comparison  with  the
cost  estimates  without the Bank's  prior written  concurrence.

Bid  Submission and Bid Opening:  Prospective bidders  shall be given at least thirty
(30)  days  from  the  date  of  publication  of  the  invitation  to  bid  or  the  date  of
availability  of the  bidding  documents,  whichever  is  later,  to  prepare  and  submit
bids. Bids  shall be opened in public, immediately  after the deadline for submission
of bids.  Bids received  after  the deadline  for  bid submission  shall  be rejected  and
returned to bidders unopened.  A copy of the bid opening minutes  shall be promptly
provided  to  all  bidders  who  submitted  bids,  and  to  the  Bank  with  respect  to
contracts  subject to the Bank's prior review.

Bid  Evaluation:  Evaluation  of  bids  shall  be  made  in  strict  adherence  to  the
evaluation  criteria  specified  in the  bidding  documents.  Evaluation  criteria  other
than  price  shall  be quantified  in  monetary  terms.  Merit  points  shall  not  be used,
and no minimum point or percentage  value shall  be assigned to the significance  of
price,  in bid evaluation.  Contracts  shall  be awarded  to the qualified  bidder  whose
bid  has  been  determined: 
to  be  substantially  responsive  to  the  bidding
documents;  and  (ii)  to  offer  the  lowest-evaluated  cost.  No  negotiations  shall  be
permitted.  A  bidder  shall  not be  required,  as  a  condition  for  award, to  undertake
obligations  not specified  in the bidding documents or  otherwise  to modify  the bid
as  originally submitted.  A bidder  shall  not be eliminated  from  detailed  evaluation
on the basis  of minor, non-substantial  deviations.

(i) 

Rejection  of All  Bids and  Re-bidding:  All  bids  (or  the sole  bid  if only  one bid is
received)  shall not be rejected, the procurement process  shall  not be cancelled,  and
new  bids shall  not be  solicited without the Bank's  prior written concurrence.

Bid  Validity:  The  bid validity period  required  by the bidding documents  shall  be
sufficient  to  account  for  any  period  that  may  be  required  for  the  approval  and
registration  of the contract as  contemplated  in the PPL.  If justified by  exceptional
circumstances,  an  extension  of bid  validity may  be requested  in  writing  from  all
bidders  before  the  original  bid  validity  expiration  date,  provided  that  such

extension  shall  cover  only  the  minimum  period  required  to  complete  the
evaluation,  award a contract, and/or complete the registration  process, but not more
than thirty (30)  days;  a corresponding  extension  of any bid guarantee  also  shall be
required  in  such  cases.  A  Bidder  may  refuse  the  request  for  extension  of  bid
validity  without  forfeiting  its  bid  guarantee.  No  further  extensions  shall  be
requested  without the prior written  concurrence  of the Bank.

Guarantees:  Guarantees  shall  be in the format included  in the bidding documents.
The  bid  guarantee  shall  be  valid  for  twenty-eight  days  (28)  beyond  the  original
validity  period  of the  bid,  or  beyond  any  period  of extension  if requested.  No
advance  payments  shall  be  made  without  a  suitable  advance  payment  guarantee.
Performance  security shall  not exceed  ten percent (10%)  of the contract  amount.

Fraud  and Corruption:  The  bidding documents  and contract  as  deemed  acceptable
by  the Bank shall  include  provisions  stating the Bank's policy to sanction firms or
individuals,  found  to  have  engaged  in  fraud  and  corruption  as  defined  in  the
Procurement  Guidelines.

Inspection  and Audit Rights:  Each  bidding document and contract  financed out the
proceeds  of the Loan  shall provide that bidders, suppliers  and contractors,  and their
subcontractors,  agents,  personnel, consultants,  service providers, or suppliers,  shall
permit  the Bank  to inspect  all  accounts,  records,  and  other  documents  relating  to
the  submission  of bids  and  contract  performance,  and  to  have  them  audited  by
auditors  appointed  by  the Bank.  Acts  intended  to  materially impede  the  exercise
of  the  Bank's  inspection  and  audit  rights  provided  for  in  the  Procurement
Guidelines  constitute an  obstructive  practice  as defined  in the Guidelines.

Contract  Modifications:  With  respect  to  contracts  subject  to  the  Bank's  prior
review,  the Borrower  shall  obtain the Bank's  no  objection before  agreeing to:  (i)
a  material  extension  of the stipulated  time  for performance  of a  contract;  (ii)  any
substantial modification of the scope of services or other  significant changes  to the
terms and conditions  of the contract; (iii) any variation  order or amendment (except
in  cases  of extreme  urgency)  which,  singly  or  combined with  all  variation  orders
or  amendments  previously  issued, increases  the original  contract  amount  by  more
than  fifteen  percent  (15%);  or  (iv)  the  proposed  termination  of the  contract.  A
copy  of all  contract  amendments  shall be provided  to the Bank.

SCHEDULE  3

Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the Loan  have been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower  on each Principal Payment Date shall  be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date; by  (b) the Installment  Share  for each Principal Payment Date,  such
repayable  amount to  be adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any  amounts  referred  to
in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to which a Currency  Conversion applies.

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Loan have  not been fully withdrawn  as  of the first Principal
Payment  Date,  the principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal Payment  Date  shall be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds  of the Loan have been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any
amounts  referred  to in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule, to  which a  Currency
Conversion applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan  withdrawn within  two  calendar  months prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date, be  treated  as

-17-

withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date  of withdrawal  and shall  be repayable on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption of such billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the Conversion  by either:  (i)  the exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance is  denominated  in more  than one Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the amount  denominated
in each  Loan  Currency, so as to produce a  separate amortization  schedule  for each
such amount.
