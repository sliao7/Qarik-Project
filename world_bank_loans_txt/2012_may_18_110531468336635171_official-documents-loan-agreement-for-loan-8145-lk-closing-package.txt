Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan have  been  fully withdrawn  as  of
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the

multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)

fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is the original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table in
paragraph  I  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment
Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining  Original  Installment
Shares for Principal  Payment Dates  falling on  or after  such date[,  such amounts  repayable

(b) 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at any
time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued  on  or
after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-paragraph  shall
no  longer apply to any  withdrawals  made after the  adoption  of such  billing  system.

4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency, the  amount  so  converted  in the Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable
on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination
immediately  prior  to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the
amounts  of principal  in the  Approved  Currency  payable by  the  Bank  under the  Currency
Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in
accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen
Rate.

5. 
If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in more than  one  Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan Currency,  so as to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for  each  such  amount.
