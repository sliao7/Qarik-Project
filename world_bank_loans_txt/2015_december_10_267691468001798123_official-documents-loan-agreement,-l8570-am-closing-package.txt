If the  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each
Principal  Payment Date shall  be determined  as follows:

Principal  Payment Date, the Borrower shall  repay  the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as
of such  date in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule.

(b)  Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first Principal  Payment Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment Date  falling after  the date  of such  withdrawal  in  amounts

fraction,  the numerator  of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the
table  in  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining

(a)  Amounts of the Loan withdrawn  within  two calendar  months  prior to any  Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any  Principal  Payment Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding
on the  second  Principal  Payment Date  following the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following  the date of withdrawal.

paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made  after the adoption of such
billing  system.

I  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the exchange rate  that
reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in the Approved  Currency  payable  by the Bank under
the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so
determines 
the  exchange  rate
component  of the Screen  Rate.

in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines, 

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount  denominated  in  each
Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for  each  such
amount.
