which  are  described  in  Section  I  of  Schedule

SCHEDULE  2

Amortization Schedule

1. 

The  following table  sets  forth  the Principal  Payment  Dates of the  Loan and the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have  been fully  withdrawn as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a) Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as  of the first Principal  Payment Date; by  (b) the Installment
Share for each Principal  Payment Date,  such repayable  amount to be adjusted,  as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

On each  January  15  and July  15

Beginning  January  15,  2021 
through  July  15,  2040

Installment Share
(Expressed  as a  Percentage)

2.50%

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Loan have not been  fully withdrawn  as of the first Principal  Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the Borrower shall repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as
of such date  in accordance  with paragraph  I  of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn after  the first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after the date of such withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by the Bank by  multiplying the amount  of each  such withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the numerator of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the
table  in  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months  prior to any  Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn and  outstanding
on the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment Date  following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the Bank adopts a due  date billing system  under which invoices  are issued  on

-9-

or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any  withdrawals  made after the adoption  of such
billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all or any portion of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall  be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the Bank  under the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component of the  Screen Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule  shall apply separately  to the  amount denominated  in  each  Loan
Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for  each  such amount.
