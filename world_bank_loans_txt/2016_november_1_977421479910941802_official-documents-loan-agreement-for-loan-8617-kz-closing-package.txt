Eligibility:  The eligibility  of bidders to participate  in a procurement process  and to

Procurement  Guidelines;  accordingly,  no  bidder  or  potential  bidder  shall  be
declared  ineligible  for contracts financed  by the  Bank for reasons  other  than those

"pass  or fail"  basis,  and  merit  points  shall  not be used.  Such  assessment  shall  be
based  entirely  upon the  bidder's  or  prospective  bidder's  capability  and  resources
to  effectively  perform  the  contract,  taking  into  account objective  and  measurable
factors,  including:  (i)  relevant  general  and  specific  experience,  and  satisfactory

period;  (ii)  financial  position;  and  where  relevant  (iii)  capability  of construction

documents.  Evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the quantifiable
criteria  declared  in  the  bidding  documents.  Evaluation  criteria  other  than  price
shall  be  quantified  in  monetary  terms.  Merit  points  and  bracketing  shall  not  be
used,  and  no  minimum  point  or  percentage  value  shall  be  assigned  to  the

of  minor,  nonmaterial  deviations.  The  procuring  entity  shall  ask  bidders  for
clarifications  needed  to  evaluate their  bids,  but shall  not  ask  or permit  bidders  to
change  the  substance  or price  of their bids after the bid opening.

Contracts shall  be awarded  to the  qualified bidder whose bid has  been determined:
(i) to  be  substantially  responsive  to  the  bidding  documents;  and  (ii)  to  offer  the
lowest-evaluated  cost.  No negotiation  as to  the price  or substance  of the  bid shall
take place.

Rejection  of Bids  and  Re-Bidding:  No  bids  shall be  rejected  solely  because they
fall  below or  exceed  the  estimated  cost or outside  of a  range  or  "bracket"  of bid
values. All  bids  (including  in the  case  when  less than two  bids  are received)  shall
not be rejected,  the  procurement  process  shall not be  cancelled,  and new bids shall
not be  solicited  without the Bank's  prior written  concurrence.

Guarantees:  Bid  and  contract  guarantees  shall  be  in  the  format  and  have  the
required  period  of  validity  specified  in  the  bidding  documents  referred  to  in

Electronic  Procurement  Systems:  Electronic  procurement  systems  may be  used,
provided  that  the  Bank  is  satisfied  with  the  adequacy  of the  systems,  including
inter  alia,  that  the  system  is  secure,  maintains  the  integrity,  confidentiality,  and
authenticity  of bids  submitted.

In  accordance  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines,  each
Fraud  and  Corruption: 
bidding  document  and  contract  shall  include  provisions  stating the  Bank's policy
to  sanction  firms  or  individuals,  found  to  have  engaged  in  fraudulent,  corrupt,
collusive,  or obstructive  practices  as defined  in the  Procurement  Guidelines.

Inspection  and Audit Rights:  In accordance  with the Procurement  Guidelines,  each
bidding  document  and  contract  financed  out  of the  proceeds  of the  Loan  shall

inspect all  accounts,  records  and  other  documents  relating  to  the  bid  submission
and  performance  of the  contract  and to  have  said  accounts and  records  audited  by
auditors  appointed  by the  Bank.  Acts  intended to  materially  impede  the  exercise
of  the  Bank's  inspection  and  audit  rights  provided  for  in  the  Procurement
Guidelines  constitute  an  obstructive  practice  as  defined  in  the  Procurement
Guidelines.

Publication  of  the  Award  of  Contract:  The  procuring  entity  shall  publish  the
following  information  on  contract award  in a  free  and  open  access  website  or on

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan have  been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal  amount  of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date  shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first Principal
Payment Date; by (b)  the  Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount to  be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts  referred to
in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule, to which  a  Currency Conversion  applies.

Installment Share
(Expressed  as a Percentage)

each  Principal  Payment Date  shall  be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds  of the Loan  have been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1 of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this Schedule,  to  which a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as

-19-

withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date of withdrawal  and  shall  be repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due  date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such  sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the  adoption of such  billing  system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that is
repayable  on any Principal Payment Date occurring  during the  Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion by either:  (i) the  exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more  than one  Loan  Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the  amount  denominated
in each Loan  Currency, so  as to  produce  a separate amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
