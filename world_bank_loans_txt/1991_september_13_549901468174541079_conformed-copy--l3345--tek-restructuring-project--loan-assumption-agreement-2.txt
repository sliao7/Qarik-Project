When contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity period, 
such period may be extended once, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph 2.59 of the Guidelines, by the minimum amount of time required to complete 
the evaluation, obtain necessary approvals and clearances and award the contract. The 
bid validity period may be extended a second time only if the bidding documents or the

reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract over the period of extension. 
Such an increase in the bid price shall not be taken into account in the bid 
evaluation. With respect to each contract made subject to the Bank’s prior review in 
accordance with the provisions of Part D.1 of this Section, the Bank’s prior approval 
will be required for (i) a first extension of the bid validity period if the period of 
extension exceeds sixty (60) days, and (ii) any subsequent extension of the bid 
validity period.

(b)

In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part A, the Borrower 

shall use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such 
modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes 
of the Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the

2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment out of 
the Special Account in respect of such contract.

(b)

With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding paragraph, 
the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall
