taken  under  the  Program  and  which  are  described  in  Section  I  of Schedule  I  to  this
Agreement;  and  (b)  the  Borrower's  maintenance  of an  adequate  macroeconomic  policy
framework.  The Borrower and the Bank therefore  hereby  agree  as  follows:

ARTICLE I - GENERAL  CONDITIONS;  DEFINITIONS

1.01. 

The General Conditions  (as defined  in the Appendix to this Agreement)  constitute
an integral  part of this Agreement.

1.02.  Unless the context requires  otherwise, the capitalized terms used  in this Agreement
have the  meanings  ascribed  to them  in the  General Conditions  or in the  Appendix
to this Agreement.

ARTICLE II - LOAN

The Bank agrees  to  lend to the  Borrower,  on the  terms and  conditions  set forth  or
referred to  in this Agreement, the amount of six hundred thirty  seven million seven
hundred  thousand  Euro  (E637,700,000),  as  such  amount  may  be  converted  from
time  to time  through  a  Currency  Conversion in  accordance  with the  provisions  of
Section 2.08  of this Agreement ("Loan").

2.02.  The Borrower may  withdraw the  proceeds  of the  Loan  in support  of the  Program

in accordance  with  Section  II  of Schedule  1 to  this Agreement.

2.03. 

The Front-end  Fee  payable  by  the  Borrower  shall  be equal  to  one  quarter  of one

not  later than  sixty days  after the  Effective  Date.

2.04.  The Commitment Charge payable  by the Borrower  shall be equal to one quarter  of

one  percent (0.25%)  per annum  on  the Unwithdrawn  Loan Balance.

equal  to  the  Reference  Rate  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Variable  Spread;
provided,  that  upon a Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  principal  amount  of
the  Loan, the  interest  payable  by  the  Borrower  during the  Conversion  Period  on
such  amount  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of
Article  IV  of the  General  Conditions.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any
amount  of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains  unpaid  when  due and  such non-
