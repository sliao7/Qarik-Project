LOAN AGREEMENT 

Agreement  dated  November  23,  2010,  entered  into  between  DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC  (“Borrower”)  and  INTERNATIONAL  BANK  FOR  RECONSTRUCTION 
AND  DEVELOPMENT  (“Bank”)  for  the  purpose  of  providing  financing  in  support  of 
the  Program  (as  defined in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement). The  Bank  has  decided to 
provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of (a) the actions which the Borrower has 
already taken under the Program and which are described in Section I of Schedule 1 to 
this  Agreement,  and  (b)  the  Borrower’s  maintenance  of  an  appropriate  macroeconomic 
policy framework.  The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as follows: 

 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 
 
1.01.  The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement) 

constitute an integral part of this Agreement. 

 
1.02.  Unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  the  capitalized  terms  used  in  this 
Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in 
the Appendix to this Agreement. 

 
ARTICLE II — LOAN 
 
2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or 
referred  to  in  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of  one  hundred  and  fifty  million 
Dollars  ($150,000,000),  as  such  amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time 
through a Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 
of this Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program 

in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. 

2.03.  The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of one 

percent (0.25%) of the Loan amount. 

 
2.04.   The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate 
equal  to  the  Reference  Rate  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Fixed  Spread; 
provided, that upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of 
the Loan, the interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on 
such  amount  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of 
Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any 
amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-
payment  continues  for  a  period  of  thirty  days,  then  the  interest  payable  by  the 

Borrower  shall  instead  be  calculated  as  provided  in  Section  3.02  (e)  of  the 
General Conditions. 

 
2.05.  The Payment Dates are March 15 and September 15 in each year. 
 
2.06.  The  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  shall  be  repaid  in  accordance  with  the

amount  of  the  Loan,  withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved 
Currency; (ii) a change of the interest rate basis applicable to all or any 
portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding 
from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice versa, or from a Variable 
Rate  based  on  a  Variable  Spread  to  a  Variable  Rate  based  on  a  Fixed 
Rate; and (iii) the setting of limits on the Variable Rate applicable to all 
or  any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and 
outstanding by the establishment of an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate 
Collar on the Variable Rate. 

Any conversion requested pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section that 
is accepted by the Bank shall be considered a “Conversion”, as defined 
in the General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the 
provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion 
Guidelines.  

Promptly  following  the  Execution  Date  for  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or 
Interest  Rate  Collar  for  which  the  Borrower  has  requested  that  the

itself  the  amounts  required  to  pay  any  premium  payable  in  accordance 
with  Section  4.05  (c)  of  the  General  Conditions  up  to  the  amount 
allocated from time to time for the purpose in the table in Section II of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  interest  rate 
basis applicable to consecutive withdrawals from the Loan Account which in the 
aggregate equal fifteen million Dollars ($15,000,000) shall be converted from the 
initial  Variable  Rate  to  a  Fixed  Rate  for  the  full  maturity  of  such  amount  in 
accordance with the provisions of the General Conditions and of the Conversion 
Guidelines.

Program, aimed to enhance performance of social sectors to promote human capital for 
the poor, include the following: 
 
1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The Borrower, through its Vice-President’s office (acting as head of the Gabinete 
de Coordinación  de  Política  Social),  has  issued  Resolution  No.  01-10,  dated 
August 2, 2010 and Resolution No. 02-10, dated August 6, 2010, approving: (i) 
the  regulations  governing  the  function  of  the  CCT  Interagency  Committee  and 
CCT  Intersectoral  Committee;  and  (ii)  the  organizational  development  plan  for 
CCT  Solidaridad  Program  (which  includes  the  updating  of  the  organizational 
structure  and  personnel  roles  in  accordance  with  the  defined  processes  for  the 
implementation  of  the  redesigned  CCT  Solidaridad  Program),  which  shall  be 
implemented by November 2011. 
 
The  Borrower,  through  its  Vice-President’s  office,  in  a  letter  dated  October  1, 
2010 has confirmed the approval (through an act of agreement from the Comité 
Técnico Intersectorial dated September 30, 2010) of the Action Plan 2010-2011 
issued  by  the  CCT  Solidaridad  Program  of  the  Gabinete  de  Coordinación  de 
Política  Social, stating  that,  by  December  2010,  90  percent  of  beneficiary 
households receiving  transfers  will  be registered in  a  Primary  Care  Unit  and/or 
school  or  have  received  a  letter  warning  of  potential  suspension  due  to 
incompliance;  and  defining  the  procedures  and  timeline  (beginning  in  January 
2011)  for  the  systematic  verification  of  co-responsibilities  in  education  and 
health,  with  the  objective  of  linking  at  least  80  percent  of  the  transfers  to  the 
beneficiaries  of  the  CCT  Solidaridad  Program  based  on  the  verification  of  co-
responsibilities. 
 
The Borrower, through its Ministry of Education, has issued: (i) Resolution No.

total  amount  of  the  cash  transferred  to  them;  and  (ii)  the  available  balance  on 
their cards through the use of a toll-free telephone line. 
 
The  Borrower  through  its  Council  of  Ministries,  has  (a)  approved  the  Multi-
Annual  National  Plan  for  the  Public  Sector  2010-2013  which  contains  the 
medium-term  guidelines  for  social  protection  policy  with  projections  as  to  the 
coverage, estimated budget, and financing bases, including the quantification of 
the service coverage gaps in education and health linked to the CCT Solidaridad 
Program  including:  (i)  initial,  basic,  and  the  first  cycle  of  middle  school 
education; (ii) primary health care and an increase in the enrollment in SENASA 
among beneficiaries of the CCT Solidaridad Program not covered by any social 
security scheme; and (iii) nutrition, including the provision of micronutrients for 
pregnant women and children under two years of age; and (b) submitted the draft 
2011 Budget Law including these cost projections to the Borrower’s Congress, as

President  dated  October  1,  2010,  confirming  the  approval  by  the  Council  of 
Ministries, and submitting a copy of said Multi-Annual National Plan, as well as 
confirming the submission of the draft Budget Law to the Borrower’s Congress. 
 
The  Borrower  has  made  available:  (a)  sufficient  resources  to  meet  the  output 
targets of the CCT Solidaridad Program that had been calculated and agreed for 
2010  as  reflected in  Article  26  of  the  2010  National Budget  Law  and  the  Nota 
Técnica  issued  jointly  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  the  Gabinete  de 
Coordinación de Política Social and the Ministry of Finance in October 2010; (b) 
strengthened  procedures  to  ensure  the  predictability  in  disbursement  for  budget 
users,  as  evidenced  by  Article  26  of  the  2010  National  Budget  Law;  and  (c) 
adequate  measures  to  monitor  and  publish  the  use  of  such  resources,  as 
evidenced  by  the  resolution  issued  by  the  CCT  Intersectoral  Committee  and 
dated  September  20,  2010,  establishing  that the results  of the  execution  of said 
budget are presented to the CCT Intersectoral Committee on a quarterly basis and 
published on the web page of the CCT Solidaridad Program or of the Ministries 
of Public Health and Education.    
 
The  Borrower,  through  separate  official  letters  from  its  Ministries  of  Public 
Health and Education, addressed to the Ministry of Economy and dated August 
30, 2010 and September 30, 2010 respectively, has agreed on the implementation 
of the institutional strengthening measures that are needed to ensure preparedness 
for the introduction of performance agreements for the Ministry of Public Health 
and the Ministry of Education. 
 
The  Borrower,  through  SESPAS  (now  Ministry  of  Public  Health),  has  signed 
separate  internal  performance  agreements  (Convenios  de  Gestión) with  each  of 
the  following  Borrower’s  regional  health  services:  Metropolitano; Valdesia;
Norcentral; Enriquillo; Nordeste; Este; El  Valle; Cibao  Occidental; and  Cibao

The  Borrower,  through:  (i)  an  internal  letter  issued  by  the  Vice  Minister  of 
Treasury  and  dated  October  1,  2010,  confirmed  the  implementation  of  the 
Consulta  Amigable  project  (to  be  carried  out  from  September  2010  to  June 
2011), which aims at creating a web-based interface to make available, over the 
internet,  data  on  the  national  budget  contained  in  the  Borrower’s  integrated 
financial management system; and the publication (beginning on September 30, 
2010)  on  the  Minister  of  Finance’s  website  (www.digepres.gob.do) of monthly 
interim  reports  on  the  execution  of  the  Borrower’s  national  budget;  and  (ii)  an 
administrative  agreement  between  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  Minister  of 
Economy    signed  on  August  18,  2010,  established  the  development  of  a  pilot 
system  to  link  budget  information  to  performance  indicators  through  the  web-
based interface described in (i) herein. 

The CCT Intersectoral Committee has issued a resolution dated August 12, 2010, 
approving  a  pilot  project  to  monitor  the  availability,  and  improve  the 
accountability of, health and education inputs linked to co-responsibilities of the 
CCT Solidaridad Program, through the use of “community scorecards” allowing 
to  gather information  on  the  services  provided,  which  shall  be  implemented  by 
April 2011, with the purpose of gradually expanding (starting in June 2011) said 
pilot project based on its results.

(a) 

 
(b) 

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment  Date, the principal amount  of  the  Loan repayable  by  the  Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such 
withdrawal  in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original 
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for 
each such amount.
