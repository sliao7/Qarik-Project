If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
2. 
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a)

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and outstanding as 
of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

(b)

Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by 
the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of 
which  shall  be  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original Installment Share) and the denominator 
of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment 
Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  repayment  amounts  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to 
deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies.

(a)

Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal  Payment 
3.
Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal 
Payment Date,  be treated  as withdrawn and  outstanding on the  second Principal  Payment Date 
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of  withdrawal.

(b)

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if at any 
time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after 
the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer 
apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 

4.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan to an Approved 
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  said  Approved  Currency  that  shall  be  repayable  on  any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank 
by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  said 
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  said 
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5.
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time shall be 
denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply 
separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate 
amortization schedule for each such amount.

For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a)

the  term  “eligible  Categories”  means  Categories  (1)  through  (6)  as  set  forth  in 

the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

(b)

the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the reasonable 
cost of goods, works and services required for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds 
of  the  Loan  allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  eligible  Categories  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c)

the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount equivalent to  $2,000,000 to 
be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the  Special  Account  pursuant  to 
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, 
the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited  to  the  amount  of  $1,000,000    until  the  aggregate 
amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall 
be equal to or exceed the equivalent of $4,000,000.

Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures

3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been 
duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish 
the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a)

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which 
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or

deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b)

(i)

For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish  to  the  Bank  requests  for  deposits  into  the  Special  Account  at

For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower shall,

(d)

once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible 
Categories,  minus  the  total  amount  of  all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  into  by  the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of  the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the 
Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify 
by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent 
that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special 
Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  eligible 
expenditures.

(a)

6.
If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the 
Special  Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible  pursuant  to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the 
Bank  may  request;  or  (B)  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  (or,  if  the  Bank  shall  so  request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so 
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into 
the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b)

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  such  outstanding 
amount.

(c)

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or  any 

portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d)

Refunds  to  the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b),  and  (c)  of  this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
