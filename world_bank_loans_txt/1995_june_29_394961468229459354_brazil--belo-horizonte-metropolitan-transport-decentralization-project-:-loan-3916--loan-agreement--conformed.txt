5. 
not be  required  to  make  further  deposits  into  the  Special  Account:

remaining on  deposit in  the  Special  Account as  of the date  of such  notice  will be utilized
in  making  payments  for  eligible  expenditures.

6. 
(a)  If the  Bank  shall have  determined  at  any  time that  any payment  out of the
Special  Account:  (i) was made  for an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible  pursuant
to paragraph  2 of this  Schedule;  or (ii)  was not justified  by the evidence  furnished  to  the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional  evidence  as the Bank may  request;  or (B)  deposit into the Special  Account  (or,
if the  Bank  shall  so request,  refund  to the  Bank)  an amount  equal to the  amount  of such
payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit by  the Bank  into the  Special  Account  shall be  made
until the Borrower  has provided  such evidence  or made such deposit or refund,  as the case
may  be.

(b)  If the Bank  shall  have  determined  at any  time  that  any amount  outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures,  the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund  to the Bank
such  outstanding  amount.

(c)  The  Borrower  may, upon  notice  to the Bank,  refund  to the  Bank all  or any

portion  of the  funds  on  deposit in  the  Special  Account.

(d)  Refunds  to the  Bank made  pursuant  to paragraphs  6  (a),  (b) and  (c)  of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of this Agreement,  including the
General  Conditions.
