Payment  Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share for each  Principal  Payment  Date, such

each  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan  have been  withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying  the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date, such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any
amounts referred  to in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn within  two calendar  months  prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as

following  the date of withdrawal  and shall  be  repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on any  Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion  by either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in  the Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the Currency Hedge  Transaction  relating to  the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component of the Screen Rate.
If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in more  than  one Loan  Currency,
the  provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to  the  amount denominated
in each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce a separate amortization  schedule for each
such amount.
