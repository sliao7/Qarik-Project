in  the table  in  paragraph  1 of Schedule  1 to this Agreement;

(b) 

the  term  "eligible  expenditures"  means  expenditures  in  respect  of the
reasonable  cost of goods and  services required  for  the Project  and to be financed  out of
the  proceeds  of the  Loan  allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  eligible  Categories  in
accordance  with the provisions  of Schedule  1 to this Agreement;  and

the  term  "Authorized  Allocation"  means  an  amount  equivalent  to
(c) 
to  be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the  Special
$1,500,000 
Account pursuant to paragraph  3 (a) of this Schedule,  provided, however, that  unless the
Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited  to  an  amount
equivalent  to  $1,000,000  until  the  aggregate  amount  of withdrawals  from  the  Loan
Account  plus the total amount of all outstanding  special commitments entered into by the
Bank  pursuant  to Section  5.02  of the  General  Conditions  shall be  equal to  or exceed  the
equivalent  of $6,000,000.

Payments  out  of  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  exclusively  for  eligible

withdrawals  to replenish  the  Special  Account  shall be  made  as follows:

(a) 

For withdrawals of the Authorized  Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish
to the  Bank  a request  or requests  for  deposit  into  the respective  Special  Account  of an
amount  or  amounts  which  do  not  exceed  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  Authorized
Allocation.  On  the  basis  of such  request  or  requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of the
Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into the  Special  Account  such
amount  or  amounts as the Borrower  shall have  requested.

(b) 

(i) 

For  replenishment  of the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the  Special Account
at  such  intervals  as the Bank shall  specify.

(ii) 

Prior  to  or at the time  of each such  request,  the Borrower  shall

- 31  -

furnish  to  the  Bank the  documents  and other  evidence  required
pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule  for  the  payment  or
payments  in respect of which replenishment  is requested.  On the
basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the
Borrower,  withdraw  from  the Loan Account and deposit into the
Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have
requested  and  as  shall  have  been  shown  by  said  documents  and
other  evidence to have been paid  out of the Special  Account  for
eligible  expenditures.  All  such deposits shall be withdrawn  by
the  Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under  the  respective  eligible
Categories,  and  in  the  respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall
have  been justified by  said  documents  and other  evidence.

For  each  payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out  of  the  Special  Account,  the

Borrower  shall,  at  such  time  as the  Bank  shall  reasonably  request,  furnish  to the  Bank
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for
eligible  expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraph  3 of this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall

5. 
not be  required  to make  further  deposits into the  Special Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals
should be made by the Borrower  dirmctly  from  the Loan Account  in accordance  with  the
provisions  of Article  V  of the General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a)  of Section 2.02  of
this Agreement;

(b) 

if the Borrower  shall have  failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period
of time  specified  in  Section  4.01  (b) (ii)  of this  Agreement,  any  of the  audit  reports
required  to be  furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section  in respect of the audit of the
records  and  accounts  for  the  Special Account;

(c) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified  the Borrower  of its intention
to  suspend  in whole  or in pwrt  the right of the  Borrower  to make  withdrawals  from  the
Loan  Account  pursuant to  the provisions  of Section  6.02  of the General  Conditions;  or

(d) 

once  the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan  allocated  to the eligible
Categories minus the total amount of all outstanding  special commitments entered  into by
the Bank  pursuant to Section  5.02 of the General  Conditions with  respect to the Project,
shall  equal  the equivalent  of twice the  amount  of the Authorized  Allocation.

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the Loan  Account  of the  remaining  unwithdrawn
amount  of the  Loan allocated  to  the eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as

- 32  -

the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further  withdrawals  shall be made
only  after and to the extent that the  Bank shall have  been  satisfied that  all such amounts
remaining  on deposit in the  Special Account  as of the  date of such notice will be utilized
in  making payments  for eligible  expenditures.

(a) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any payment out of the
6. 
Special  Account:  (i) was  made  for  an expenditure  or in an amount  not eligible  pursuant
to paragraph  2 of this Schedule; or (ii)  was not justified by the evidence  furnished to the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional evidence as the Bank may request;  or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or,
if the  Bank shall so request,  refund  to the Bank) an  amount equal to the amount of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree,  no further  deposit by  the  Bank into the  Special  Account  shall be  made  until the
Borrower  has  provided  such evidence  or made  such deposit  or refund,  as  the  case may
be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank
such  outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower  may, upon  notice  to the  Bank,  refund  to  the Bank  all  or

any  portion  of the  funds  on  deposit in  the Special  Account.

(d) 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs  6 (a), (b) and (c) of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with the  relevant  provisions  of this Agreement,  including  the
General  Conditions.
