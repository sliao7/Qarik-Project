Program  (as  defined  in  the Appendix  to  this  Agreement).  The Bank  has  decided  to  provide  this
financing  on  the basis,  inter alia, of:  (a)  the actions  which the  Borrower has  already  taken  under
the  Program  and  which  are  described  in  Section  I  of  Schedule  1 to  this  Agreement;  and  (b)  the
Borrower's  maintenance  of an  adequate  macroeconomic  policy  framework.  The  Borrower  and
the Bank therefore  hereby agree  as  follows:

ARTICLE  I - GENERAL  CONDITIONS;  DEFINITIONS

1.01. 

The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement)  constitute  an
integral  part  of this  Agreement.

Agreement.

ARTICLE II - LOAN

2.01.  The Bank agrees  to  lend to the  Borrower, on the terms and conditions  set  forth or referred
to  in this  Agreement,  the amount  of two  hundred  million Dollars  ($200,000,000),  as  such
amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time  through  a  Currency  Conversion  in
accordance  with the  provisions of Section 2.07  of this Agreement  ("Loan").

2.02. 

2.03. 

The  Borrower  may  withdraw  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  in  support  of  the  Program  in

(0.25%)  of the Loan amount.

2.04.  The  interest  payable  by  the  Borrower  for  each  Interest  Period  shall  be  at  a  rate  equal  to
the  Reference  Rate  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Fixed  Spread;  provided,  that  upon  a
Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the principal  amount  of the  Loan, the  interest payable
by  the  Borrower  during  the  Conversion  Period  on  such  amount  shall  be  determined  in
accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any  amount  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains
unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment  continues  for  a  period  of thirty  days,  then  the
interest  payable  by the  Borrower  shall  instead  be  calculated  as  provided  in  Section  3.02
(e)  of the General  Conditions.

2.05. 

The Payment  Dates  are  March  15  and  September  15  in each  year.

Variable  Rate  or  the  Reference  Rate  applicable  to  all  or  any  portion  of  the

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the

Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by
multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be
adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any amounts referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,
to which  a  Currency  Conversion  applies.

2. 

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each
Principal  Payment  Date  shall be determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance
as  of such  date in accordance  with paragraph  1 of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling after the date  of such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the Bank by multiplying  the amount  of each  such withdrawal  by a
fraction, the  numerator  of which is  the original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted, as  necessary,  to deduct  any  amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of
withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing
with the second Principal Payment  Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if  at  any
time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued

- 7-

on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of
such billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on any
Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the
Conversion Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan Currency,  so  as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
