After  the  Bank  has  received  evidence  satisfactory  to  it  that  the  Special 
Account has been opened, withdrawals from the Loan Account of amounts to be

5. 
The Bank shall  not be required  to  make  further  deposits  into  the  Special 
Account in accordance with the provisions of Part B.2 of this Schedule if, at any 
time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower and the Guarantor of its intention 
to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from 
the Loan Account pursuant to Section 6.02 of the General Conditions.  Upon such

Expenditure,  or  was  not  justified  by  the  evidence  furnished  to  the  Bank,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  provide  such  additional 
evidence as the Bank may request, or deposit into the Special Account (or, if the 
Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such 
payment.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank 
into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  until  the  Borrower  has  provided  such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  payments  for  Eligible 
Expenditures  during  the  six-month  period  following  such  determination,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  such

withdrawals  shall  be  made  only  after  and  to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have 
been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account 
as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  Eligible 
Expenditures.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
1. 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  
(a)  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  as  of  the  first 
Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such 
repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

4.45% 

2. 
If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  not  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the  Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of  the first  Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  amount  withdrawn  and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) 

Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, 
the  numerator  of  which  shall  be  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in 
paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original  Installment 
Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such repayment amounts 
to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(a) 

3. 
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on 
any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second 

- 27 -

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following 
the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if 
at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such subparagraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall be 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period shall be 
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  said  Conversion  by  either:  (a)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the 
amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (b)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in 
accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate  component  of  the  Screen 
Rate. 

If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
5. 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall 
apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a 
separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
