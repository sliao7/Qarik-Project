opportunity  to  bid.  This  will  be  done  by  advertising  invitations  to  apply  for
inclusion  in a bidder's  invitation  list, to apply  for prequalification,  or to bid;  such
advertisements  should be  placed  in  at least  one newspaper  of general  circulation
in the Borrower's  country  and,  in addition,  in at  least one  of the following  forms:

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

a notice in the United Nations publication,  Development Forum,
Business Edition;  or

an advertisement  in a newspaper,  periodical  or technical journal
of wide  international  circulation;  or

a  notice  to  local  representatives  of  countries  and  territories
referred  to  in  the  Guidelines,  that are  potential  suppliers  of the
goods  required."

(b) 

The  following  is  added  at  the  end  of paragraph  2.21  of the  Guidelines:

"As  a  further  alternative,  bidding  documents  may  require  the  bidder  to
state  the  bid  price  in  a  single  currency  widely  used  in  international  trade  and
specified  in  the  bidding  documents."

(c) 

Paragraphs  2.55  and  2.56  of the  Guidelines  are  deleted.

(d) 

For  fixed-price  contracts,  the  invitation  to  bid  referred  to  in  paragraph
2.13  of the  Guidelines  shall  provide  that,  when  contract  award  is  delayed  beyond  the
original  bid  validity  period, the  successful  bidder's  bid price  will  be  increased  for  each

week  of delay  by  two  predisclosed  correction  factors  acceptable  to  the  Bank,  one  to  be
applied  to all foreign  currency  components  and the  other to the local currency  component
of the  bid  price.  Such  an  increase  shall  not  be  taken  into  account  in  the  bid evaluation.

(e) 

In  the  procurement  of goods  in  accordance  with  this  paragraph  1,  the
Borrower  shall use the relevant  standard  bidding documents  issued by the Bank, with such
modifications  thereto  as  the  Bank  shall have  agreed  to  be  necessary  for  the  purposes  of
the  Project.  Where  no  relevant  standard  bidding  documents  have  been  issued  by  the
Bank, the Borrower  shall use bidding documents based on other internationally  recognized
standard  forms  agreed  with  the  Bank.

Contracts  for  the  procurement  of goods  estimated  to  cost the  equivalent  of less

2. 
than  $2,000,000  shall  be  awarded:

(a) 

by  purchasers  required  to  follow  the  Borrower's  public  procurement
procedures  for  the  importation  of goods,  on  the  basis  of such procedures,  provided  that
such  procedures  shall have  been  found  acceptable  by the  Bank;  and

(b) 

by  other  purchasers,  in  accordance  with  established commercial  practice,
provided  that  such  contracts  shall  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of comparison  of quotations
obtained  from  suppliers  from  at  least  two  countries,  except  that  direct  contracting
procedures  acceptable  to  the  Bank  may  be  used  where  considered  appropriate  under
paragraph  3.5  of the  Guidelines.

3. 
Subject  to  the prior  approval  of  the Bank,  commonly  traded  commodities  (such
as  grain,  sugar,  cooking  oil  and  industrial  raw  materials)  may  be  procured  through
organized  international  commodity markets  or other channels  of competitive  procurement
acceptable  to  the  Bank,  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to the  Bank.

4. 
With  respect  to  each  contract  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule,  the
Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the  Bank,  prior  to  the  submission  to  the  Bank  of  the  first
application  for  withdrawal  of funds  from  the Loan  Account  in  respect  of such  contract,
two  conformed  copies  of such contract,  together  with the  analysis  of the  respective  bids
and recommendations  for award,  a description  of the advertising  and tendering  procedures
followed  and  such  other  information  as the  Bank  shall  reasonably  request.

5. 
With  respect  to  each  contract  referred  to  in paragraphs  2  and  3  of this Schedule,
the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the  Bank,  prior  to  the  submission  to the  Bank  of the  first
application  for  withdrawal  of  funds  from  the  Loan  Account  in  respect  thereof,  such
documentation  and information  as the Bank may reasonably request to support withdrawal
applications  in  respect  of such  contract.
