The  following  table sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds of the Loan have  been fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment  Date, the  principal amount of the Loan
repayable by  the Borrower on each  Principal Payment  Date shall  be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by (b) the Installment  Share  for each Principal  Payment  Date, such
repayable  amount to be  adjusted, as  necessary,  to deduct  any  amounts  referred  to
in paragraph  4 of this Schedule,  to which  a Currency  Conversion applies.

If the proceeds  of the  Loan  have not been  fully withdrawn  as of the  first Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal Payment  Date  shall be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds  of the Loan have  been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined by the Bank  by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date, such  amounts  repayable to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct any

-11-

3. 

(a) 

amounts  referred to  in paragraph  4 of this Schedule, to  which  a Currency
Conversion applies.

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within two calendar  months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating the
principal amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on 
following the date of withdrawal  and shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment  Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made  after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on any  Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying such  amount  in its  currency of
denomination  immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate
that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in the  Approved  Currency  payable  by the
Bank  under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

S. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in  more  than  one Loan  Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately  to the amount  denominated
in each  Loan Currency, so as  to produce a separate amortization  schedule for each
such  amount.
