(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such  sub-paragraph shall no longer  apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption  of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination immediately  prior to the Conversion by either:  (i) the exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency Hedge Transaction  relating to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component of the Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more than  one Loan Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount  denominated
in each Loan Currency, so  as to produce a separate amortization  schedule  for each
such amount.
