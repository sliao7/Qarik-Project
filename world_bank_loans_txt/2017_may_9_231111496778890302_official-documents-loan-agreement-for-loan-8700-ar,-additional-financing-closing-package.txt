SCHEDULE3

Amortization Schedule

The following table  sets  forth the Principal Payment  Dates of the Loan and  the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have been fully withdrawn  as of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by the  Borrower  on
(a)
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment
Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

If the proceeds  of the Loan have  not been fully withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment Date shall be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal Payment  Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as
of such  date in  accordance  with paragraph  1 of this Schedule.

Any amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after the date  of such withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the Bank  by multiplying the  amount  of each such withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the numerator  of which is the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the
table in  paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on or  after  such
date, such amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted, as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months prior to  any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable on  any Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as withdrawn  and outstanding
on the  second Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date of withdrawal  and shall

-18-

be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if at  any
time the  Bank adopts a due date billing  system under  which invoices are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by the Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule shall  apply separately to the  amount denominated  in each Loan
Currency,  so  as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each such amount.
