such  date  in  accordance  with paragraph  I  of this  Schedule.

Any  amount withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on each
Principal  Payment Date falling  after the date of such withdrawal  in amounts determined
by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the
numerator  of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share specified  in the table  in paragraph
I  of this  Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")  and
the denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for

adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this
Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on
the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be
repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal
Payment  Date  following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any  time
the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued  on  or  after
the respective  Principal  Payment  Date, the  provisions  of such  sub-paragraph  shall  no
longer  apply to  any withdrawals  made  after the  adoption  of such  billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved  Currency,
the amount  so converted  in the Approved  Currency that is  repayable  on  any Principal  Payment
Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,  shall be  determined  by the  Bank by  multiplying
such amount  in  its currency of denomination  immediately prior to  the  Conversion by either:  (i)
the  exchange  rate  that reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in the  Approved  Currency payable  by
the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the Conversion;  or (ii)  if the Bank
so  determines  in accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate component  of
the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance  is denominated  in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions
of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so
as  to produce  a  separate amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
