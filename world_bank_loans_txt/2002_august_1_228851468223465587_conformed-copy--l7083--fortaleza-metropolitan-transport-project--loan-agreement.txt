Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which 
in the aggregate do not exceed the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of each such request, the 
Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the 
Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b)

For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the 
Bank requests  for deposit  into the  Special Account  at such intervals  as the  Bank shall  specify. 
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents 
and  other  evidence  required  pursuant  to  Part  B.3  of  Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement  for  the 
payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such 
request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit 
into  the  Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have  requested  and  as  shall  have 
been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account 
for Eligible Expenditures. Each such deposit into the Special Account shall be withdrawn by the 
Bank from the Loan Account under one or more of the Eligible Categories.

3.
The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account, once 
the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  minus  the  total  amount  of  all  outstanding  special 
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall 
equal  the  equivalent  of  twice  the  amount  of  the  Authorized  Allocation.  Thereafter,  withdrawal 
from  the  Loan  Account  of  the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  shall  follow  such 
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall 
be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining  on  deposit  in  the  Special  Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in 
making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

Operation of Special Account
When Withdrawals Are Made

On the Basis of Project Management Reports

1.
Except  as  the  Bank  may  otherwise  specify  by  notice  to  the  Borrower,  all  withdrawals 
from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Special Account in accordance 
with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. Each such deposit into the Special Account 
shall  be  withdrawn  by  the  Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under  one  or  more  of  the  Eligible 
Categories.

Each  application  for  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  for  deposit  into  the  Special 

2.
Account shall be supported by a Project Management Report.

3.
Upon  receipt  of  each  application  for  withdrawal  of  an  amount  of  the  Loan,  the  Bank 
shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special 
Account an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount so requested; and (b) the amount which 
the  Bank  has  determined,  based  on  the  Project  Management  Report  accompanying  said 
application,  is  required  to  be  deposited  in  order  to  finance  Eligible  Expenditures  during  the 
six-month  period  following  the  date  of  such  report;  provided,  however,  that  the  amount  so 
deposited,  when  added  to  the  amount  indicated  by  said  Project  Management  Report  to  be 
remaining in the Special Account, shall not exceed EUR19,720,000.

1.
between road and rail based systems, consisting of:  (i) about 19 line-kilometers of infrastructure 
and superstructure works, rehabilitation of about 13 bridges and viaducts, rehabilitation works in 
the  areas  surrounding  the  stations  and  in  the  grade  crossings,  and  road  works  in  the  area  of 
influence  of  such  line;  (ii)  installation  of  signalling,  telecommunications  and  electrification 
facilities,  escalators  and  elevators,  a  central  control  system,  automatic  train  control  equipment, 
air conditioning, ventilation, fans and ancillary equipment; and (iii) acquisition of rolling stock 
(eight train sets); and (b) carrying out of the Resettlement Plan.  

2.

1.
use  and  air  quality  management  strategy  for  the  FMR  to  meet  appropriate  transport  and  air 
quality  targets  and  to  introduce  sound  cost-recovery,  tariff,  regulatory  and  subsidy  policies, 
including a study on the integration of the public transportation system in the FMR, covering the 
physical,  operational,  financial  and  institutional  aspects  of  the  integration  of  the  transportation 
modalities in the FMR (the Transport Integration Study).

2.
Provision of technical assistance: (a) for the strengthening of RTCC’s capacity to carry 
out  its  functions;  and  (b)  if  necessary,  in  matters  related  to  the  transfer  of  ownership,

SCHEDULE 3

Amortization Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
1.
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date 
(Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) the total principal 
amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the 
Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as 
necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a 
Currency Conversion applies.

If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal 
Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a)

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as of the 

(a)

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and outstanding as 
of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

(b)

Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by 
the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of 
which  shall  be  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original Installment Share) and the denominator 
of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment 
Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  repayment  amounts  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to 
deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies.

(a)

3.
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal  Payment 
Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal 
Payment Date,  be treated  as withdrawn and  outstanding on the  second Principal  Payment Date 
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of  withdrawal.

(b)

Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if at any 
time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after 
the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such subparagraph shall no longer apply 
to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 

4.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan to an Approved 
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  said  Approved  Currency  that  shall  be  repayable  on  any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank 
by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  said 
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  said 
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5.
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time shall be 
denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply 
separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate 
amortization schedule for each such amount.
