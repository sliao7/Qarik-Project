Payment  Date; by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for each Principal  Payment Date,  such

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar months  prior  to  any

Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices

of such  sub-paragraph  shall no  longer apply  to  any withdrawals made  after
the  adoption  of such billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any  portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior  to  the Conversion  by  either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
