Part A: 

International Competitive Bidding

by  the minimum amount  of  time  required to  complete the evaluation,
obtain  necessary  approvals  and  clearances  and  award  the  contract.
The  bid validity period may  be  extended  a second time  only  if  the
bidding  documents  or  the  request  for  extension  shall  provide  for
appropriate  adjustment  of  the  bid  price  to  reflect  changes  in

an  increase  in  the  'id  price  shall  not  be  taken  into  account  in  the
bid  evaluation.  With  respect  to  each  contract  made  subject  to  the
Bank's  prior  review  in accordance with the  provisions  of  Part  D.1
(a)  of  this  Section,  the  Bank's  prior  approval  will  be  required  for

extension  exceeds  sixty  (60)  days;  and  (ii) 
any  subsequent  extension
of  the bid validity period.

(b)  In  the  procurement  of  goods  and works  in  accordance  with
this  Part A, the  Borrower  shall  use the  relevant  standard  bidding
documents  issued  by  the  Bank,  with  such modifications  thereto  as  the

payment out of  the Special Account:  (i) was made for an expenditure
