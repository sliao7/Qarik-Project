     (a)  For withdrawals of the respective Authorized Allocations,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for

Special Accounts such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have
requested.

     (b)  (i)  For replenishment of the Special Accounts, the Borrower

               each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
               Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
               into the respective Special Account such amount as
               the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have

under the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equi-
valent amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and
other evidence.

4.   For each payment made by the Borrower out of a Special Account,
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request,
furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that

such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the
Special Accounts:

     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement;

     (b)  if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,

Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the
Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records
and accounts for the Special Accounts;

of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions;

     (d)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Categories for Part A of the Project, minus the total
amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to Part A of the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the
amount of the Authorized Allocation; or

     (e)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Categories for Part B of the Project, minus the total
amount of all outstanding special commitments with respect to Part B
of the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of
the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories for
Parts A and B of the Project shall follow such procedures as the Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals
shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have
been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the
Special Accounts as of the date of such notice will be utilized in
making payments for eligible expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of a Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to
the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:
(A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or
(B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless
the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into
the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in a Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.

     (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General

Conditions.
