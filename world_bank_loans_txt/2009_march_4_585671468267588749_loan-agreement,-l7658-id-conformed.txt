LOAN AGREEMENT 
 

Agreement  dated  March  4,  2009,  entered  into  between  REPUBLIC  OF

AND  DEVELOPMENT  (“Bank”)  for  the  purpose  of  providing  financing  in  support  of 
the Program (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).  The Bank has decided to 
provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of (a) the actions which the Borrower has 
already taken under the Program and which are described in Section I of Schedule 1 to 
this Agreement, and (b) the Borrower’s maintenance of an appropriate macro-economic 
policy framework.  The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as follows: 

 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 
 
1.01.  The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement) 

constitute an integral part of this Agreement. 

 
1.02.  Unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  the  capitalized  terms  used  in  this 
Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in 
the Appendix to this Agreement. 

 
ARTICLE II — LOAN 
 
2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or 
referred  to  in  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of  two  billion  United  States  Dollars

Currency  Conversion  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section  2.07  of  this 
Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program 

in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. 

2.03.  The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of one

interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on such amount 
shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of 
the  General  Conditions.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the 
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains  unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment

of  such  Withdrawal  does  not  exceed  eighteen  (18)  years  from  the 
Withdrawal  Date  and  the  final  maturity  of  such  Withdrawal  does  not 
exceed thirty (30) years from the Withdrawal Date (or such other average 
maturity  and/or  final  maturity  as  may  be  generally  applicable  to  loans 
made  by  the  Bank  to  the  Borrower  at  the  time  of  such  agreement)  and  
(ii) such repayment provisions have been agreed between the Borrower 
and the Bank prior to the Withdrawal Date of such Withdrawal.

Agreement  and  relating  to  Cooperation  and  Consultation),  the  Borrower  shall

SCHEDULE 1 
 
Program Actions; Availability of Loan Proceeds 
 

Section I. 

Actions Taken under the Program

The actions taken by the Borrower under the Program include the following: 

Policy Area:  Reassuring Financial Markets and Maintaining Financial System Stability 
 
1. 

The Borrower has issued a financial safety net government regulation in lieu of 
law (Perpu No. 4/2008) that establishes the roles, responsibilities and procedures 
that will govern the actions and responsibility of Bank Indonesia, the Ministry of 
Finance,  and the  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  in the  event  of  the  failure  of  a 
financial institution. 

The Borrower has taken steps to maintain the stability of its banking system by:  
(a) issuing a government regulation in lieu of law (Perpu No. 3/2008)  increasing 
the  ceiling  on  deposit  insurance  from  100  million  to  2  billion  Rupiah  and 
allowing  the  Borrower  to  provide  a  blanket  guarantee  of  all  bank  deposits  if 
necessary;  and  (b)  issuing  a  government  regulation  in  lieu  of  law  (Perpu  No. 
2/2008) that amends the Bank  Indonesia Law clarifying the types of assets that 
banks can use as collateral for borrowing from the central bank. 

The  Borrower,  through  a  letter  of  the Minister  of  Finance  and  the  Governor  of 
Bank Indonesia, has initiated a financial sector assessment program (Letter dated 
December 24, 2008). 

The Borrower has issued and committed to implementation of the Financing Plan 
for Fiscal Year 2009 that specifies the terms and circumstances under which the 
Borrower  would  draw  on  financing  support  that  is  available  from  the  Public 
Expenditure  Support  Facility  and  from  Indonesia’s  development  partners 
providing  related  support  (Director  General  of  Debt  Management  Decree  No. 
KEP04/PU/2009, dated January 27, 2009). 

 
Policy  Area:    Sustaining  Critical  Public  Expenditures  while  Maintaining  Budget 
Discipline 
 
5. 

The  Borrower  has  established  a  crisis  monitoring  and  response  system  in 
anticipation  of  a  possible  growth  slowdown  or  crisis  (BAPPENAS  Ministerial 
Directive (Surat Penugasan) 0014/M.PPN/01/2009 dated January 27, 2009). 

The Borrower has submitted a Presidential Decree on Coordination of National 
Poverty Reduction efforts to the President for signature. 

 
2. 

 
3. 

 
4. 

 
6. 

7

The Borrower has included specific provisions in the 2009 budget law (Law No. 
41/2008) to sustain, and if necessary, increase critical public expenditures in the 
event of a pronounced growth slowdown. 

The  Borrower  has  implemented  specific  regulatory  measures  (Regulation  Nos. 
240/PMK.05/2008;  06/PMK.02/2009;  and  15/KMK.05/2009)  and  socialization 
efforts to expedite budget disbursements and enhance the ability of the Borrower 
to rapidly direct public expenditures to preempt, as well as mitigate, any adverse 
impacts of a growth slowdown. 

 
Crowding in Private Investment and Supporting Exports 
 
9. 

The Borrower has prepared and has undertaken inter-ministerial review of a draft 
of a Presidential Regulation on the implementation of the 2007 Investment Law 
and Investment Negative List (DNI) that accommodates Indonesia’s international 
commitments  on  sectoral  restrictions  and  clarifies  the  status  of  publicly  listed 
companies,  foreign  equity  limits  for  direct  investment,  grandfathering  and  the 
creation  of  investment  restrictions  beyond  those  stipulated  in  the  Investment 
Negative List.   

The Borrower has taken steps to increase transparency regarding revenues from 
extractive industries by: (a) issuing a memorandum of understanding among the 
Coordinating  Minister  for  Economic  Affairs,  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the 
Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources (MOU-01/M.EKON/01/2009; MOU-
54/MK/2009;  0274/05/MEM/2009)  on  Transparansi  Pendapatan  Negara  Yang 
Diperoleh dari Industri Ekstraktif; and (b) issuing a letter from the Coordinating 
Minister for Economic Affairs to the Secretariat of the EITI initiating the process 
of application to the EITI (Letter No. S-125/M.EKON/12/2008). 

The  Borrower  has:  (a)  opened  a  re-discount  window  for  trade  finance  through 
Bank  Indonesia  (Regulation  No.  10/34/PBI/2008);  and  (b)  created  an  export 
financing agency (Law No. 2/2009).

TOTAL AMOUNT 

Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds. If, at any time prior to the receipt by the Bank 
of a request for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, the Bank determines that a 
review of the Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework or of its progress in 
carrying  out  the  Program,  including  the  Financing  Plan,  is  warranted,  the  Bank 
shall give notice to the Borrower to that effect.  Upon the giving of such notice, 
no withdrawals shall be made of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance unless and until 
the Bank has notified the Borrower of its satisfaction, after an exchange of views 
as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of said Section 3.01, with (1) the progress 
achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program, including the Financing 
Plan  and  (2)  the  appropriateness  of  the  Borrower’s  macroeconomic  policy 
framework. 

Deposits of Loan Amounts.  Except as the Bank may otherwise agree:   
 
1. 

all  withdrawals from  the  Loan  Account  shall  be  deposited  by  the  Bank 
into an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank; 
and 

 
2.  

the  Borrower  shall  ensure  that  upon  each  deposit  of  an  amount  of  the 
Loan  into  this  account,  an  equivalent  amount  is  accounted  for  in  the 
Borrower’s  budget  management  system,  in  a  manner  acceptable  to  the 
Bank. 

Excluded  Expenditures. The  Borrower  undertakes  that  the  proceeds  of  the 
Loan shall not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures.  If the Bank determines 
at  any  time  that  an  amount  of  the  Loan  was  used  to  make  a  payment  for  an 
Excluded Expenditure, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, 
refund  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  such  payment  to  the  Bank.  Amounts 
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. 

Closing Date.  The Closing Date is December 31, 2010.
