this Section),  the  Borrower  shall pay  to the  Bank a surcharge  at the rate  of

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a

Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any  Principal  Payment Date occurring during the  Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to  the Conversion  by either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the

the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately to  the  amount  denominated
in each  Loan  Currency,  so as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
