(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share’’) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date[, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount. -10-1.
