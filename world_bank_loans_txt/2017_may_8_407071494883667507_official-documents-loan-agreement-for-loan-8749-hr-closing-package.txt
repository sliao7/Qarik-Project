(ii) 

Participation  of Government-owned  Enterprises

Government-owned  enterprises  located  and  operating  on the Borrower's  territory

withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable by  the Borrower  on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date; by  (b)  the Installment  Share  for each  Principal  Payment Date,  such
repayable  amount  to  be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts  referred  to
in paragraph  4 of this Schedule,  to which  a Currency  Conversion  applies.

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have  been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this
Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct any
amounts  referred to  in  paragraph  4 of this Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within  two calendar  months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

-21

following the date  of withdrawal  and  shall be  repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time  the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1 and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment Date  occurring during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than one Loan  Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount  denominated
in  each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a  separate amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
