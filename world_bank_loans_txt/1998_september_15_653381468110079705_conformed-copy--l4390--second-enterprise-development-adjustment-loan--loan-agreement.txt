hundred million Dollars ($300,000,000).

Section 2.02. (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and 

(f) of this Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the proceeds of the 
Loan from the Loan Account in support of the Program.

(b)

The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank, the first 

request for withdrawal from the Loan Account, and thereafter maintain in its central 
bank, a deposit account in Dollars on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. 
All withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit 
Account.

(c)

The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used 

to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan 
shall have been used to make a payment for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment; or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, 
refund such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall 
be credited to the Loan Account for cancellation.

Maximum Withdrawal Amount as defined herein. For purposes of this sub-paragraph, the

thereafter, beginning in November 1998, shall be equal to seventy million dollars 
($70,000,000). In the event that the aggregate amounts of loan proceeds actually 
disbursed from the Loan Accounts for the Associated Loans in any given month shall be 
less than the amount of the Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for such month, the difference 
between such actual monthly disbursements and the Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling shall be 
permitted to be carried over as an additional amount which shall be added to the 
Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for the next succeeding month.  Such carry-over shall 
continue from month to month as long as any portion of a Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling 
remains unwithdrawn.

(e)

No withdrawals shall be made from the Loan Account: (i) after the 

aggregate of the proceeds of the Loan withdrawn from the Loan Account shall have 
reached the equivalent of one hundred million Dollars ($100,000,000), unless the Bank 
shall be satisfied, after an exchange of views as described in Section 3.01 of this 
Agreement based on evidence satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) with the progress achieved 
by the Borrower in the carrying out of Program; and (iii) that the actions described

of views, the Bank shall have given notice to the Borrower that the progress achieved 
and actions taken are not satisfactory and, within 90 days after such notice, the 
Borrower shall not have achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the Bank,

Loan or any part thereof.

aggregate of the proceeds of the Loan withdrawn from the Loan Account shall have

Agreement based on evidence satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) with the progress achieved 
by the Borrower in the carrying out of Program; and (iii) that the actions described 
in Section II of Schedule 3 to this Agreement have been taken.  If, after said 
exchange of views, the Bank shall have given notice to the Borrower that the progress 
achieved and actions taken are not satisfactory and, within 90 days after such notice, 
the Borrower shall not have achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the 
Bank, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan or any part thereof.

the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later 
date.
