deposited into the Special Account pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Annex; provided, however, that

$100,000,000.

(a)

For withdrawals of the Authorized

of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the

into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested.

(b)

For replenishment of the Special Account, 

the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for

Bank the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to Part B.3 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement 
for the payment or payments in respect of which 
replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such 
request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said 
documents and other evidence to have been paid out of 
the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures. Each 
such deposit into the Special Account shall be 
withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under one 
or more of the Eligible Categories.

The Bank shall not be required to make further 

3.
deposits into the Special Account, once the total 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan, minus the total amount 
of all outstanding special commitments entered into by 
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, 
withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such 
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit

application, is required to be deposited in order to 
finance Eligible Expenditures during the six-month 
period following the date of such report; provided,

exceed the equivalent of $100,000,000.
