                                 SCHEDULE 2

                          Description of the Project

      The objectives of the Project are: (a) to assist the Borrower in
promoting medium and long-term market-based financial flows into the

mortgage market by providing PFIs with a source of liquidity for their
medium and long-term lending for mortgages; (b) to facilitate compe-
tition in market-based mortgage lending; and (c) to improve the enabling
environment for private sector development of land and housing produc-
tion.

      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from
time to time to achieve such objectives:

1.    Provision by the SMF of medium and long-term financing to PFIs
for Mortgage Loans on owner-occupied and rental residential housing
which satisfies the requirements of Schedule 3 to the Project
Agreement.

2.    Carrying out of a program to improve the institutional capabi-
lities of the SMF to provide medium and long-term financing for the
housing sector through staff training, overseas visits, introduction
of a management information system, equipment, and provision of legal
and financial services to develop the SMF’s operating procedures.

Part A

Part B

1.    Carrying out of a program of regulatory reform in the housing
sector to increase development of land and housing by the private
sector for low and moderate income households through: (i) granting
full rights to the private sector to adopt and use the more affordable
plot sizes and building standards developed and used by HUDC; (ii)
increasing the availability of land zoned for small plot sizes; and
(iii) revising urban planning, land use and building regulations to
promote more efficient use of land and reduce construction costs.

2.    Carrying out of a program to transform HUDC from a public sector
producer of serviced land to a facilitator and promoter of private
sector development of land and housing for low and moderate income
households.

                                  * * *

      The Project is expected to be completed by September 30, 2001.

out the Project.

2.    (a)   For the purpose of ensuring the proper supervision of the

other method satisfactory to the Bank: (i) in 1996, the greater of

220 housing plots or 20 percent of total land plots for which

exempted from limits imposed by the Company Law upon the issuance of
corporate debt; (ii) income derived from SMF bonds is exempted from

holds the SMF’s bonds; and (iv) the SMF’s loans to financial insti-
tutions are treated as interbank lending for regulatory purposes.

      (b) The Borrower shall ensure, by December 31, 1996, that
streamlined procedures, satisfactory to the Bank, for the registration
and transfer of liens shall apply to the SMF.

shall furnish the following reports, of such scope and in such
detail as the Bank may reasonably request:

during the period following such date; and

      (c)   review with the Bank, by July 1, 1998, or such later date

from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

      (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means with respect to the
special account to be established under Part A of the Project an

Special Accounts pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.

2.    Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made exclusively for
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the
Special Accounts have been duly opened, withdrawals of the respective
Authorized Allocations and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Accounts shall be made as follows:

      (a)   For withdrawals of an Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or
deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of such Authorized
Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall,
on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
in the respective Special Account such amount or amounts as the
Borrower shall have requested.

      (b)   (i)    For replenishment of the Special Accounts, the
                   Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                   deposits into the Special Accounts at such
                   intervals as the Bank shall specify.

            (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                   Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents
                   and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph
                   4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in
                   respect of which replenishment is requested. On
                   the basis of each such request, the Bank shall,
                   on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
                   Account and deposit into the Special Accounts
                   such amount as the Borrower shall have requested
                   and as shall have been shown by said documents
                   and other evidence to have been paid out of the

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account
under the eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other
evidence.

4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Accounts, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reason-
ably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence
showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.

5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,

Special Accounts:

      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

      (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,

Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the
Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records
and accounts for the Special Accounts;

      (c)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

      (d)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the
amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and tothe extent that the 
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

6.    (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Accounts: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Accounts (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Accounts shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Accounts will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such out-
standing amount.

      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts.

      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
