Section I.  Procurement  of  Goods

Part A: 

International Competitive Bidding

Except  as provided  in  Part C hereof,  goods  shall be procured
1. 
under  contracts  awarded 
in  accordance  with  procedures  consistent
with  those  set  forth  in  Sections  I  and  II  of  the  "Guidelines  for
Procurement  under  IBRD  Loans  and  IDA  Credits"  published  by  the  Bank
in May  1992  (the Guidelines).

(a) 

For  fixed-price  contracts,  the  invitation  to  bid
referred to  in paragraph 2.13  of  the Guidelines shall provide that,
when  contract  award 
is  delayed  beyond  the  original  bid  validity
period,  the  successful  bidder's  bid  price  will  be  increased  for  each
week of delay by  two predisclosed correction  factors  acceptable to
the Bank, one to be  applied to  all  foreign currency  components and
the other to  the local currency component  of the bid price. Such an
increase shall not  be taken into account  in the bid evaluation.

(b)  In the procurement of  goods  in accordance with Parts  A
and  C.1  of  this  Schedule,  the  Borrower  and  WASA  shall  use  the
relevant  standard bidding  documents  issued by  the  Bank, with such
modifications  thereto  as  the  Bank  shall  have  agreed  to  be  necessary
for the  purposes  of  the  Project.  Where  no  relevant  standard  bidding
documents have been issued by  the Bank, the Borrower and WASA shall
use  bidding  documents  based  on  other  internationally  recognized
standard forms  agreed with the  Bank.

To  the  extent  practicable,  contracts  for  goods  shall  be
2. 
grouped  into  bid  packages  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of
$150,000  or  more.

Part B: 

Preference for Domestic Manufacturers  and Regional
Manufacturers

For the purposes of evaluation and comparison of bids  for the
1. 
supply  of  goods:  (a)  bidders  shall  be  required  to  state  in  their  bid
(port  of  entry)  price  for  imported  goods,  or  the  ex-
the  c.i.f. 
factory  price  for  domestically-manufactured  goods;  (b)  customs
duties  and  other  import  taxes  on  imported  goods,  and  sales  and
similar  taxes  on  domestically-supplied  goods,  shall  be  excluded;  and

- 33  -

(c) the cost of inland freight  and other expenditures incidental to
the  delivery  of  goods  to  the  place  of  their  use  or  installation
shall be  included.

For  goods manufactured  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago  and  in member
the  Borrower  and  WASA  may  grant  a  margin  of
the  following

and  subject 

to, 

in 

(a)  All  bidding  documents  for  the  procurement  of  goods  shall
clearly  indicate  any  preference  which  will  be  granted,  the  informa-
tion  required  to  establish  the  eligibility  of  a  bid  for  such
preference  and  the  following  methods  and  stages  that  will  be
followed in the  evaluation  and  comparison of  bids.

(b)  After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified  in

one of  the  following groups:

(i) 

if 

Group  A:  bids  offering  goods  manufactured  in
Trinidad  and  Tobago, 
the  bidder  shall  have
established  to the  satisfaction of the Borrower
or  WASA  and  the  Bank  that  the  manufacturing  cost
of  such  goods  includes  a  value  added  in  Trinidad
and  Tobago  equal  to  at  least  20%  of  the  Ex-
factory bid price  of  such goods.

(ii) 

Group  B:  all  other  bids  offering  goods  from
within Trinidad  and Tobago.

(iii) 

Group  C:  bids  offering  goods  manufactured 
in  a
country,  other  than Trinidad  and  Tobago, which
is  a  party  to  CARICOM  and  entitled  to
preferential tariffs  thereunder.

(iv) 

Group D:  bids offering  any other goods.

(c)  All  evaluated  bids  in  each  group  shall  be  first 

compared
among  themselves,  excluding  any  customs  duties  and  other  import
taxes  on  goods  to  be  imported  and  any  sales  or  similar  taxes  on
goods  to  be  supplied  domestically,  to  determine  the  lowest  evaluated
bid  of  each  group.  The  lowest  evaluated  bid  of  each  group  shall  then
be  compared  with  each  other,  and  if, 
as  a  result  of  this  comparison,
a  bid  from  group  A  or  group  B 
it  shall  be  selected
for the award.

(d)  If,  as  a result of  the  comparison under  paragraph  (c)
above, the lowest bid is a bid  from group C or  group D, all group  C
and  group  D  bids  shall  be  further  compared  with  the  lowest  evaluated
bid from group A or group B after  adding to the  evaluated bid price
of  the  imported  goods  offered in  each group C and  group D bid, for
the  purposes  of  this  further  comparison  only,  an  amount  equal  to  the
smaller of:  (i) the amount  of  customs duties and other import  taxes
which a nonexempt importer would have to pay for  the importation of
the  goods  offered  in  such  group  C  or  group  D  bid;  or  (ii)  15%  of the
c.i.f. 
said  customs  duties  and  taxes

bids shall be finally compared with the lowest bid from group  C, as
determined  under  paragraph  (c)  above,  after  adding  to  the  evaluated
bid price of  goods  to be  imported  offered in  each group D bid, for
the purposes  of  this  final  comparison only, an amount  equal  to  the
the  difference  between  the  amount  of  customs  duties
smaller  of:  (i) 
and  other  import  taxes  which  would  actually  be  payable  for  the
importation  of  goods  offered  in  such  group  D  bid  and  for  the
15%  of  the
importation  of  goods  offered  in  the  group  C  bid;  or  (ii)
