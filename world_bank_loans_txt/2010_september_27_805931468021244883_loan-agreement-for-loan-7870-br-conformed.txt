The Project consists of the following parts: 

Part 1:    

Water Availability Increase 

Carrying out of activities aimed to control and reduce real water losses within the Critical 
Watersheds,  including  inter  alia:  determination  of  baseline  water  losses,  sectorization 
into district metered areas, installation of pressure controls, implementation of macro and 
micro-metering, development of a technical cadastre, implementation of active control of 
leaks,  management  of  networks  and  infrastructure,  and  improvements  in  the  speed  and 
quality of repairs (the Water Loss Control and Reduction Subprojects). 

Carrying  out  of  activities  aimed  to  improve  water  consumption  efficiency  in  selected 
public  schools  through  a  more  rational  use  of  water  including,  inter  alia,  diagnosis  of 
water  consumption  practices  and  potential  for  reduction,  installation  of  water-saving 
appliances  such  as  improved  faucets  and  toilets,  and  implementation  of  awareness 
campaigns to educate students and teachers to economize their use of water (the Water 
Rational Use Subprojects).  

Carrying  out  of  activities  aimed  to  incentivize  the  reuse  of  treated  wastewater  for 
industrial, agricultural and other purposes and develop reuse techniques including,  inter 
alia:  building  of  additional  treatment  facilities  and  networks  to  transport  treated 
wastewater to the end user (the Treated Wastewater Reuse Subprojects).

Watersheds, including, inter alia: constructing new wastewater treatment plants in areas 
linked  to  the  Critical  Watersheds  where  wastewater  is  currently  untreated  and  where 
treatment  plants  offer  satisfactory  solutions,  and  upgrading  existing 
small-size 

  

wastewater  systems  to  raise  their  effluent  quality  standards  (the  Wastewater  Treatment 
Plant Upgrading and/or Construction Subprojects). 

Institutional and Technical Strengthening

Withdrawal Conditions; Withdrawal Period   

Notwithstanding the provisions of Part A of this Section, no withdrawal shall be made for 
payments  made  prior  to  the  date  of  this  Agreement,  except  that  withdrawals  up  to  an 
aggregate amount not to exceed $5,000,000 equivalent may be made for payments made

If the Bank shall have determined at any time after the expiration of the terms of 
a  PPA  that  a  Service  Provider  has  failed  to  deliver  any  of  the  Outputs  of  a 
Subproject that would enable the Borrower to call for a refund of earlier financed 
Outputs as mentioned in Section I.B.  1 (a) (i) (VIII) of this Schedule, the Bank 
may  at  that  time  obtain  a  refund  to  the  Bank  from  the  Borrower  of  an  amount 
equal to the amount of Loan proceeds disbursed to finance those earlier Outputs. 

  

(b)  

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be credited 
to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance

2.  

 
 

 

 

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date 

On each June 15 and December 15 
 
 

Beginning June 15, 2015 
through December 15, 2039 

 

Installment Share 
(Expressed as a Percentage) 

2% 

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal 
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

 
(b) 

 
3. 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment  Share”)  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion 
applies. 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and 
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 

  

on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of 
such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved 
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction 
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the 
provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
