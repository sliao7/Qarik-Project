To  the extent  that any proceeds  of the  Loan have been  withdrawn  as  of the first
Principal  Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance  as
of such date in accordance  with paragraph  1 of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first Principal  Payment  Date  shall be repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date falling  after the date of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the Bank by  multiplying  the amount  of each  such withdrawal  by  a
fraction, the numerator  of which  is the original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table in paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for said Principal  Payment  Date ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date, such amounts repayable  to be adjusted, as  necessary, to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  (2)  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the purposes  solely of calculating the principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of

-16-

withdrawal  and  shall  be repayable  on  each Principal  Payment  Date commencing
with the second Principal  Payment Date following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if at  any
time the Bank  adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1 and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency payable  by the Bank  under the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the Conversion;  or (ii)  if the Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange rate component  of the Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this  Schedule shall  apply separately to the amount  denominated  in each Loan
Currency,  so  as to produce a  separate amortization  schedule for each such amount.
