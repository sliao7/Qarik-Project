the total  principal amount  of the Loan payable  on each  Principal  Payment  Date ("Installment

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan  repayable  by the Borrower on each Principal
Payment  Date  shall be determined  by the  Bank by multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan Balance
as of the first Principal  Payment Date; by (b) the Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower shall  repay the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as of
such  date in accordance  with paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount withdrawn  after the  first Principal  Payment Date shall  be repaid  on each
Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a

in paragraph  1 of this Schedule  for said Principal  Payment Date ("Original  Installment
Share")  and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment
Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  amounts
repayable to be adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts referred  to in paragraph
4 of this  Schedule, to which a  Currency Conversion  applies.

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within two  calendar  months  prior to  any  Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable on  any  Principal  Payment  Date, be  treated  as withdrawn and outstanding  on
the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall  be
repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal
Payment Date following  the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at any time
the Bank adopts  a due date billing system  under which invoices are  issued on or after
the respective  Principal  Payment  Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph  shall no
longer  apply to  any withdrawals  made after the adoption  of such  billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all or  any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved  Currency,
the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable  on any Principal  Payment
Date occurring during the Conversion Period,  shall be determined  by the Bank by multiplying
such amount  in its currency  of denomination  immediately  prior  to the  Conversion  by either:
(i) the exchange  rate  that reflects  the amounts  of principal  in the Approved Currency  payable
by  the  Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the Conversion;  or (ii)  if the
Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate
component  of the  Screen Rate.

5. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in each  Loan
Currency,  so as to  produce a  separate amortization  schedule  for each such  amount.
