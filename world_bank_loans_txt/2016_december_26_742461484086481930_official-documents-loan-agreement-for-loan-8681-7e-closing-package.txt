Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
the  Bank  so  determines

the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the amount  denominated
in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
