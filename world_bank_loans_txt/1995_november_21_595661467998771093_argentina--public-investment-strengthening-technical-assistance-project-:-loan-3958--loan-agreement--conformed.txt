the table  in paragraph  I  of Schedule  1 to this Agreement;

(b) 

the  term  "Eligible  Expenditures"  means  expenditures  in  respect  of  the
reasonable  cost  of goods  and  services  required  for the Project and to  be financed  out of the
proceeds  of the  Loan  allocated  from  time to  time  to  the  Eligible  Categories  in  accordance
with the provisions  of Schedule  1 to this Agreement;  and

(c) 

the  term  "Authorized Allocation"  means  an  amount equivalent to  $750,000
to  be  withdrawn  from the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  in the  Special  Account  pursuant to
paragraph  3 (a) of this Schedule.

Payments  out  of  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  exclusively  for  Eligible

2. 
Expenditures in accordance  with the provisions of this Schedule.

After the Bank  has received  evidence  satisfactory to it that the  Special  Account has

been  duly opened,  withdrawals  of the Authorized  Allocation  and  subsequent withdrawals  to
replenish the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  as follows:

(a) 

For  withdrawals  of the  Authorized  Allocation,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish
to  the  Bank  a  request  or  requests  for  a  deposit  or  deposits  which  do  not  exceed  the
aggregate  amount  of the  Authorized  Allocation.  On  the  basis  of such  request  or  requests,
the  Bank shall,  on  behalf of the Borrower,  withdraw  from  the Loan Account  and deposit  in
the  Special Account  such amount  or amounts  as  the Borrower  shall  have requested.

(ii) 

For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall

Prior  to  or  at  the  time  of each  such  request,  the  Borrower  shall
furnish  to  the  Bank  the  documents  and  other  evidence  required
pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule  for  the  payment  or
payments  in respect  of which  replenishment  is  requested.  On the
basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the

- 23  -

Borrower,  withdraw from  the Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the
Special  Account  such  amount  as 
the  Borrower  shall  have
requested  and  as  shall  have  been  shown  by  said  documents  and
other  evidence  to  have been  paid  out  of the  Special  Account  for
Eligible Expenditures.

All  such  deposits  shall be  withdrawn by the  Bank from  the  Loan Account  under the
respective  Eligible  Categories,  and  in the respective  equivalent amounts, as  shall  have been
justified  by  said documents  and other  evidence.

For each  payment  made by  the Borrower out of the  Special  Account, the  Borrower
4. 
shall,  at such  time as  the Bank  shall  reasonably request,  furnish to the  Bank such  documents
and  other  evidence  showing  that  such  payment  was  made  exclusively  for  Eligible
Expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraph  3  of this  Schedule,  the Bank  shall not

5. 
be required  to make further deposits into the  Special  Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the  Bank shall  have  determined  that all  further  withdrawals
should  be  made  by  the  Borrower  directly  from  the  Loan  Account  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of Article  V  of the  General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a)  of Section  2.02  of this
Agreement;

to  be  furnished  to  the  Bank  pursuant  to  said  Section  in  respect  of the  audit  of the  records
and accounts  for the Special  Account;

(c) 

if, at any time, the  Bank shall  have  notified the  Borrower of its intention  to
suspend  in  whole  or  in  part the  right of the  Borrower  to  make  withdrawals  from  the  Loan
Account  pursuant to the provisions of Section  6.02  of the General  Conditions;  or

(d) 

once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of the  Loan  allocated  to  the  Eligible
Categories,  less  the  amount  of any  outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by  the
Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of the  General  Conditions  with  respect  to  the  Project,  shall
equal the  equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized  Allocation.

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of  the  remaining  unwithdrawn
amount of the Loan  allocated  to the  Eligible Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as the
Bank  shall specify  by  notice to the Borrower.  Such further  withdrawals  shall  be  made  only

- 24 -

after  and  to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that  all  such  amounts
remaining  on deposit  in  the  Special  Account  as of the  date  of such  notice  will be  utilized  in
making payments  for Eligible Expenditures.

(a) 

If the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at any  time that  any  payment  out  of the
6. 
Special  Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not eligible  pursuant  to
paragraph  2 of this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was not justified  by the evidence  furnished  to the Bank,
the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such  additional
evidence  as the  Bank  may  request;  or (B)  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  (or,  if the Bank
shall so  request,  refund  to the Bank) an  amount equal  to the amount  of such payment  or  the
portion  thereof not  so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank  shall otherwise  agree,  no further
deposit by the Bank into the  Special Account  shall  be made  until the Borrower has  provided
such evidence  or made  such deposit  or refund,  as the case may  be.

(b) 

If  the Bank  shall  have  determined  at any  time that  any amount  outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  Eligible
Expenditures, the  Borrower shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank
such  outstanding amount.

(c) 

The Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the Bank,  refund  to the  Bank  all  or any

portion  of the funds on deposit  in the  Special  Account.

(d) 

Refunds  to  the Bank made pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of this  Agreement,  including  the
General  Conditions.
