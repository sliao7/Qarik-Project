first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such

of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original

Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to  the Conversion by either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the Currency Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  detennines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more  than  one Loan  Currency,
the  provisions of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the  amount  denominated
in each Loan Currency,  so as to produce a separate  amortization  schedule for  each
such amount.
