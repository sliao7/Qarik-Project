percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal  Payment Date,  the principal  amount  of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall be  determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share  for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any  amounts  referred  to
in paragraph  4 of this Schedule,  to which  a Currency  Conversion  applies.

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Loan  have not been  fully withdrawn  as  of the first Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds  of the Loan  have  been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to which  a  Currency
Conversion applies.

-21-

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within  two calendar  months  prior  to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal  and shall  be repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date  billing system  under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no  longer apply to  any  withdrawals  made  after
the adoption  of such  billing  system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date  occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to  the Conversion by either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines 
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in more  than one  Loan  Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the amount  denominated
in  each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a  separate amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
