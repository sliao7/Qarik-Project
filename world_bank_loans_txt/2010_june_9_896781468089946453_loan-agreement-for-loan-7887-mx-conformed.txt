LOAN AGREEMENT 
 
Agreement  dated  June  9,  2010,  entered  into  between  UNITED  MEXICAN  STATES 
(“Borrower”) represented by Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, its Ministry of Finance 
and  Public  Credit  (SCHP)  and  INTERNATIONAL  BANK  FOR  RECONSTRUCTION  AND 
DEVELOPMENT (“Bank”) for the purpose of providing financing in support of the Program (as 
defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).  The Bank has decided to provide this financing on 
the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions which the Borrower has already taken under the Program 
and  which  are  described  in  Section  I  of  Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement;  and  (b)  the  Borrower’s 
maintenance of an appropriate macro-economic policy framework.   
 
Whereas the Borrower has informed the Bank that the proceeds of the Loan (as set forth in the 
table in Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement and for purposes of supporting the Program), 
shall  be  used  in  conformity  with  the  requirements  of  the  Borrower’s  income,  budgetary  and 
public  debt  laws  and  the terms  of  this  Agreement,  the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  hereby  agree  as 
follows: 

 

 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS

integral part of this Agreement.

the  meanings  ascribed  to  them  in  the  General  Conditions  or  in  the  Appendix  to  this 
Agreement. 

 
ARTICLE II — LOAN 
 
2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or referred 
to  in  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of  seven  hundred  million  Dollars  ($700,000,000),  as 
such  amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time  through  a  Currency  Conversion  in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  As a consequence of the Borrower’s maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic policy 
framework  and  its  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Program,  the  Borrower  may 
withdraw or may cause NAFIN to withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance with 
Section  II  of  Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement.  Unless  the  Borrower’s  representative 
designated in Section 6.01 of this Agreement otherwise informs the Bank, the Borrower’s 
representative  for  purposes  of  taking  any  action  required  or  permitted  to  be  taken 
pursuant  to  this  Section  is  the  Director  de  Organismos  Financieros  Internacionales  of 
NAFIN or any person or persons whom such representative shall designate in writing. 

 
2.03.  The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of one percent

2.04.   The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate equal to

Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the interest payable 
by  the  Borrower  during  the  Conversion  Period  on  such  amount  shall  be  determined  in 
accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions.  
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains 
unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment  continues  for  a  period  of  thirty  days,  then  the 
interest payable by the Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 
(d) of the General Conditions. 

 
2.05.  The Payment Dates are June 15 and December 15 in each year. 
 
2.06.  The  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  shall  be  repaid  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of

the  Loan  Currency  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan, 
withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved  Currency;  (ii)  a  change  of  the 
interest rate basis applicable to all or any portion of the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice 
versa; and (iii) the setting of limits on the Variable Rate applicable to all or any

General  Conditions,  and  shall  be  effected  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion Guidelines.  

Promptly following the Execution Date for an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate 
Collar for which the Borrower has requested that the premium be paid out of the

the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to  itself  the  amounts  required  to  pay  any  premium 
payable in accordance with Section 4.05 (c) of the General Conditions up to the
