(i) 

(ii) 

Eligibility  to  participate  in  a  procurement  process  and  to  be  awarded  a  Bank-
financed  contract  shall  be  as  defined  under  Section  I  of  the  Procurement
Guidelines;  accordingly,  no  bidder  or  potential  bidder  shall  be  declared
ineligible  for such contract  for reasons  other than those provided in Section  I of
the  Procurement  Guidelines.  No  restriction  based  on  nationality  of  bidders
and/or  origin  of goods  shall  apply,  and  foreign  bidders  shall  be  allowed  to
participate  in NCB  without  application  of restrictive  conditions.

All  invitations  to prequalify  or bid  shall  be  advertised  in  a  national newspaper
of wide  circulation  in  the  Borrower's  country,  or  on  a  widely  used  website  /
electronic  portal  with  free  national  and  international  access  acceptable  to  the

(v) 

(vi)

bidders  shall be allowed to  inspect  and purchase  bidding documents  at any time

Standard  Bidding Documents  acceptable  to the  Bank shall be used.

Qualification  requirements  of  bidders  and  the  method  of  evaluating  the
qualification of each bidder shall be specified in detail in the bidding documents.

Prequalification  procedures  and documents  acceptable to the Bank shall be used
for  large,  complex  and/or  specialized  works.  Verification  of the  information
upon which a bidder was prequalified,  including  current commitments,  shall be
carried out at the time of contract  award,  along with the bidder's capability  with
respect  to  personnel  and  equipment.  All  bidders  that  meet  the  qualification
criteria  set  out  in  the  pre-qualification  documents  shall  be  allowed  to  bid,  and
there  shall  be  no  limit  on  the  number  of  pre-qualified  bidders.  Where  pre-
qualification is not used, the qualification  of the bidder who  is recommended  for
award  of  contract  shall  be  assessed  by  post-qualification,  applying  the
qualification criteria  stated in the bidding documents.

Registration  shall  not be used  to  assess  bidders'  qualifications.  A  bidder shall
not  be  required  to  register  as  a  condition  for inspecting  or purchasing  bidding
documents,  submitting its bid or receiving  contract award.  A bidder determined
to  be  the  lowest  evaluated  responsive  bidder,  shall  be  given  reasonable
opportunity  of registering  (if required)  before  contract  signing without  any  let
or  hindrance.  Bidding  shall  not  be  restricted  to  any  particular  class  of
contractors,  and non-classified  contractors  shall also  be eligible  to bid.

(vii)  No  margins  of preference  of any  sort  shall  be  given  to bidders,  such  as on the
basis  of their  location,  place of incorporation,  or affinity  with the  geographical
area in which the  Project activities  will take place.

(viii)  All  bidders  who  are  awarded  contracts  for  works  and  single-responsibility
contracts  shall  be  required  to  provide  performance  security  in  an  amount
sufficient to protect  the Borrower  or the Project Implementing  Entity /  Entities,
as  the  case  may  be,  in  case  of breach  of contract  by  the  contractor,  and  the
bidding documents  shall  specify the  required form and amount  of such security
and any other potential  damages  for such breach.

Bidders shall be  allowed to  submit  bids by mail or in person.

-11-

(x) 

(xi)

be  present  (either  in person  or through  their representatives)  at  the time  of bid

All  bid  evaluation  criteria  shall  be  disclosed  in  the  bidding  documents  and
quantified  in monetary terms or expressed  in the  form of pass/fail requirements.

No  bid may be rejected  solely on the  basis  that  the bid  price  exceeds  any  cost
estimate  or  falls  outside  any  margin  or  bracket  of  prices  or  average  bids
established by the Borrower or the Project Implementing  Entity / Entities,  as the
case  may  be.  Rejection  of  all bids  or  re-bidding  shall  not  be  allowed  solely
because  the  number of bids  is  less  than  three  (3),  and  rejection  of all bids  or
rebidding shall not  take place without the  Bank's prior written agreement.

(xiii)  Each contract  shall  be  awarded to  the  lowest  evaluated  responsive  bidder,  that
is,  the  bidder  who  meets  the  appropriate  standards  of capability  and  resources
and whose  bid  has  been  determined:  (A)  to  be  substantially  responsive  to  the
bidding  documents;  and  (B)  to  offer  the  lowest  evaluated  cost.  The  winning
bidder  shall  not  be  required,  as  a  condition  of  award, 
to  undertake
responsibilities  for  work  or  to  assume  other  obligations  not  stipulated  in  the
bidding documents  or otherwise  to modify the bid as originally  submitted.  No

contract  shall  include  provisions  stating  the  Bank's  policy  with  respect  to

establish  that  they:  (A)  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous;  (B)  operate
under  commercial  law;  and  (C)  are  not  a  dependent  agency  of  the  agency
conducting  the procurement.

-12-

recommendation  for contracts  subject  to  the  Bank's  prior  review,  and  within
two  (2)  weeks  of  the  Borrower  or  the  Project  Implementing  Entity's  award
decision for contracts  subject to the Bank's post review.  The bidding documents
shall  disclose  the  newspaper  in  which and  /  or the  electronic  means  by  which
the information  on contract  award will  be published.

(xix)  The Borrower or the Project  Implementing  Entity / Entities,  as  the case may  be,
