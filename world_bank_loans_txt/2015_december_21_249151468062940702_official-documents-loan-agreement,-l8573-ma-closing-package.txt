SCHEDULE  2

Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan  and the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds of the Loan have  been fully withdrawn as of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  principal  amount of the  Loan repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by 
the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a) Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as  of the first Principal  Payment Date; by (b)  the Installment
Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a Currency
Conversion applies.

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Loan have not  been  fully withdrawn  as  of the  first Principal  Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  shall  be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal Payment  Date, the Borrower  shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance as
of such  date in accordance  with paragraph  I  of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date falling after  the date  of such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by the Bank  by  multiplying  the amount of each  such withdrawal  by a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is the  original  Installment  Share specified  in the
table  in paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to be adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct any  amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within  two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on any  Principal  Payment Date, be  treated as  withdrawn and  outstanding
on the  second Principal  Payment  Date following  the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if at  any
time  the  Bank adopts  a due date  billing system  under which  invoices  are issued  on

or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-
paragraph shall  no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after the adoption of such
billing  system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan  Balance to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion  Period, shall be determined  by  the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component of the Screen  Rate.

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply  separately to the  amount  denominated  in  each Loan
Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization schedule  for each such amount.
