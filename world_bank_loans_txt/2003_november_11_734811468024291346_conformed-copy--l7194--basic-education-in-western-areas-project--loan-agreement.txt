SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
1. 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn two 
months  prior  to  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  current  billing  system  pursuant  to 
Section 3(a) of this Schedule), the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower 
on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) the 
total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding two months prior to the first 
Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such 
repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in 
paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion  applies.  The  principal 
amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  two  months  prior  to  the  first  Principal 
Payment  Date  shall  be  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  from  the  Loan 
Account up to July 15, 2011, minus the aggregate amounts prepaid by the Borrower up to 
July 15, 2011, in accordance with Section 2.02 of the Tripartite Arrangement.

2.  
If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn two months prior 
to the first Principal Payment Date, the total principal amount of the Loan repayable by 
the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn 
two  months  prior  to  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the 
amount withdrawn and outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule. 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn in 
the  six-month  period  commencing  on  the  date  falling  two  (2)  months  prior  to  the  first 
Principal  Payment  Date  and  ending  on  the  date  falling  four  (4)  months  after  the  first 
Principal Payment Date or in any subsequent six-month period (in each case commencing 
on  a  date  falling  two  (2)  months  prior  to  any  Principal  Payment  Date  and  ending  on  a 

- 20 -

date falling four (4) months after such Principal Payment Date), the Borrower shall repay 
the  Net  Repayment  Amount  (as  the  term  is  defined  below)  in  respect  of  such  six  (6) 
month period, if any,  on each Principal Payment Date after the period for which such Net 
Repayment  Amount  has  been  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  relevant  Net 
Repayment  Amount  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  shall  be  the  original 
Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal 
Payment Date (the Original Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the 
sum  of  all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling 
after  the  period  for  which  such  Net  Repayment  Amount  is  determined.  The  repayment 
amounts so calculated to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. For purposes of 
this  paragraph  the  term  “Net  Repayment  Amount”  means  the  aggregate  of  all 
withdrawals from the Loan Account made in any six-month period consisting of the two 
months  immediately  prior  to  and  the  four  months  immediately  following  any  Principal 
Payment  Date  minus  the  amount  prepaid  by  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  Section 
2.02 of the Tripartite Arrangement during the same six-month period. 

(a) 

Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
3. 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if  at  any  time  the  Bank  shall adopt  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which invoices  are 
issued  on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of  such 
billing system.  

 4. 
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall  be  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule 
shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
