If the Bank has not received evidence of full compliance with the qualitative DLIs (DLI #2 and DLI #6) listed in Schedule 5 to this Agreement, with respect to any Loan disbursement under Category (1) (as referred to in the Project Operational Manual and in the Additional Instructions), then: (a) the Bank shall withhold the corresponding withdrawal attributable to each DLI not complied with; (b) the Borrower shall prepare and furnish to the Bank a satisfactory time-bound action plan specifying the measures to achieve full compliance of such DLI or DLIs in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (c) as soon as the Bank is satisfied that said action plan has been implemented, the Bank shall authorize the withdrawal of unwithdrawn Loan amount by which the corresponding Loan withdrawal had been reduced in the withdrawal period following the date of implementation of said action plan, all as further detailed in the Additional Instructions. If the Borrower fails to provide satisfactory evidence of sufficient Eligible Expenditures incurred under a respective EEP in respect to any withdrawal request under Category (1) (as referred to in the Project Operational Manual and in the Additional Instructions), then the correspondent undisbursed amount due to the lack of Eligible Expenditures shall be carried forward to the subsequent withdrawals and may be paid only if evidence of enough Eligible Expenditures are presented under the subsequent withdrawal request. -16-  In the event that the Bank has not approved a full withdrawal by the Borrower of the Loan proceeds under Category (1) due to partial evidence of compliance with the DLIs, and /or lack of documentation of Eligible Expenditures, or lack of satisfactory performance by the Borrower under an action plan referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the corresponding amount of the Loan after the last Loan withdrawal (as referred to in the Project Operational Manual and in the Additional Instructions). If, at any time, the Bank determines that: (a) any portion of the Loan Proceeds was used for items improperly procured in violation of Section III to this Schedule; or (b) was not used for Eligible Expenditures; or (c) in case of the EEPs under Part | of the Project, was not supported by evidence of actual spending by the Borrower under said Eligible Expenditure Programs and/or (d) by evidence of satisfaction of other criteria set forth in this Agreement or in the Project Operational Manual, the Borrower shall promptly refund any such portion to the Bank as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. The Closing Date is December 31, 2020. The Bank may grant an extension of the Closing Date only after the Guarantor’s Ministry of Finance has informed the Bank that it agrees with such extension. -17-SCHEDULE 3 Amortization Schedule The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date (“Installment Share”). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.   Principal Payment Date Installment Share (Expressed as a Percentage)   On each March 15 and September 15 Beginning March 15, 2020 through March 15, 2035 3.13% On September 15, 2035 2.97 %           If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: (a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. (b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph | of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after -18-  the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount. -19--0C-                                                                     o0s‘z0E's o0s‘ZoE's I80°7Z189€7I1 2011 ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ . . . .
