contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in 
Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 
published by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines).

2.
To the extent practicable, contracts for civil works and contracts for goods 
shall be grouped in bid packages to cost the equivalent of $5,000,000  or more and 
$250,000 or more, respectively.  

Part B:
 

Preference for Domestic Manufacturers

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 

A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in 
accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the 
Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto, provided, however, that:

All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly  indicate any 

1.
preference which would be granted, the information required to establish the 
eligibility of a bid for such preference and the following methods and stages that 
will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.

2.
groups:

After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the following two 

(1)

Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the bidder shall 
established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that 
components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of 

have 
such goods contain 
the value of the complete 
 

goods.

(2)

Group B: bids offering any other goods.

In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, all evaluated bids 

 
3.
in each group shall first be compared among themselves, without taking into account 
customs duties and other import taxes levied in connection with the importation, or 
the sales and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of the 
goods pursuant to the bids. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be compared with 
each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, 

it shall be selected for the award.

If, as result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the lowest evaluated 

4.
bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared with the lowest 
evaluated bid from group A after adding: (i) to the evaluated bid price of goods to be 
imported in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the amount of 
customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay 
for the  importation of the goods offered in such group B bid; or (B) 15% of the 
c.i.f. bid price of such goods, and (ii) to the ex-factory bid price of goods supplied 
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the 
amount of customs duties and other import taxes which would be levied on the goods 
offered in such group B if they originated from the same foreign country as the bid 
included in group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other imported taxes, 
or (B) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. If, as result of this 
comparison, the bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if 
not, the lowest evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, 
shall be selected for the award.

Part C:
 

Other Procurement Procedures
