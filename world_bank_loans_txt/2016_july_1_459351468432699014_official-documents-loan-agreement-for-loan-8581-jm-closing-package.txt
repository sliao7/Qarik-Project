Payment  Date ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal  Payment Date, the principal  amount  of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the  Bank by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date; by (b) the Installment  Share  for each Principal Payment  Date,  such
repayable  amount to  be adjusted,  as  necessary, to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to

first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1 of this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such

Conversion  applies.

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within two  calendar months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such  sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption  of such billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all or  any portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date  occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion  by either:  (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more  than one  Loan  Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the  amount  denominated
in  each Loan  Currency, so as to produce  a  separate amortization  schedule  for each
such amount.
