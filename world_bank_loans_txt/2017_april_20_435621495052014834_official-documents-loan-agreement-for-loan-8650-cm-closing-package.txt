first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn 
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this 
Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of such 
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount 
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the

Schedule for  said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share") 
and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining  Original 
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such 
date,  such amounts repayable to be adjusted,  as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal  Payment Date shall,  for the  purposes  solely of calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date,  be treated as

following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal 
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices 
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions 
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after 
the adoption of such billing system. 

Notwithstanding the provisions  of paragraphs  1 and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved  Currency,  the amount  so  converted in the  Approved Currency that  is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall  be determined by the Bank by multiplying  such amount  in its  currency of 
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (a) the exchange rate 
that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in the Approved Currency payable by the 
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion;  or (b)  if 
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this  Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each 
such amount.
