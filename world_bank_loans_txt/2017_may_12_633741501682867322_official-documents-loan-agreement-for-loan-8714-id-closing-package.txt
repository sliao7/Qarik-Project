longer  apply to  any withdrawals  made  after the  adoption of such billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency

the  amount  so converted  in the Approved  Currency that  is  repayable  on any Principal  Payment
Date  occurring during  the Conversion  Period,  shall  be determined  by the  Bank  by multiplying
such  amount  in  its currency of denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion by either:  (i)
the  exchange  rate  that reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the Approved  Currency  payable by
the  Bank  under the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the Conversion,  or  (ii)  if the Bank
