Section 3.07.  Financing Taxes

(a) 

This  Agreement  may  specify  that  the  proceeds  of the  Loan  may not  be
withdrawn to pay for Taxes levied  by, or in  the territory  of, the Member  Country on or in
respect  of Eligible  Expenditures,  or  on  their  importation,  manufacture,  procurement  or
supply.  In  such  case,  if the  amount  of any such  Taxes  decreases  or  increases,  the  World
Bank  may, by notice to the Borrower, adjust  the percentage  of such  Eligible  Expenditures
to  be  financed  out  of the proceeds  of the Loan  specified  in this  Agreement,  as required to
ensure  consistency  with such  limitation on withdrawals.

-26-

(b) 

In the absence  of such specification,  the use of any proceeds  of the Loan
to  pay  for  such  Taxes  is  nevertheless  subject  to  the  World  Bank's  policy  of requiring
economy  and efficiency  in the use of the  proceeds  of its  loans.  To  that  end, if the  World
Bank at any time determines that the amount of any such Tax is excessive,  or that such Tax
is  discriminatory  or  otherwise  unreasonable,  the  World  Bank  may,  by  notice  to  the
Borrower,  adjust  the percentage  of such  Eligible  Expenditures  to be  financed  out of the
proceeds  of the  Loan  specified  in this  Agreement,  as  required  to ensure  consistency  with
such policy of the World  Bank.

Section  3.08.  Reallocation. If,  in  the  World  Bank's  opinion,  an  amount  of the  Loan
allocated  to  a  category  of  Eligible  Expenditures  under  the  Loan  Agreement  will  be
insufficient  to  finance  the  expenditures  under  such  category,  the  World  Bank  may,  by
notice to the  Borrower:

(a) 

reallocate  to  such  category  any  other  amount  of the  Loan  which  in  the
World Bank's opinion is  not needed  for other Eligible  Expenditures,  to the  extent  required
to  meet the estimated  shortfall;  and

(b) 

if such reallocation  will  not fully meet  the estimated  shortfall,  reduce  the
percentage  of Eligible  Expenditures  to  be  financed  under  such  category,  in  order  that
further  withdrawals  for such  expenditures  may continue  until  all  such  expenditures  have
been made.

ARTICLE  IV

amount  of any Loan  Payment  then  due,  it  shall  have  the  right  to  allocate  and  apply the

(b) 

If the Borrower  shall  so request,  the World Bank  shall,  acting as agent  of
the  Borrower,  and  on  such  terms  and  conditions  as  the  World  Bank  shall  determine,

payment  by the  Borrower  of sufficient  funds  for that purpose  in  a  currency  or  currencies
acceptable  to the World Bank; provided, however,  that the Loan  Payment  shall be deemed
to  have  been  paid  only  when  and  to  the  extent  that  the  World  Bank  has  received  such
payment  in the Payment  Currency.

and  effecting  the  deposit  of  such  currency  to  the  account  of the  World  Bank  with  a
depository of the World Bank  authorized to accept deposits  in  such currency.

(b) 

All  Loan Payments  shall be paid without  restrictions  of any kind imposed
by, or  in the  territory  of, the  Member  Country  and without  deduction  for, and  free  from,

World  Bank all such  information as  the World  Bank shall reasonably  request  with respect
to  financial  and economic  conditions  in its territory, including its balance of payments and
its  External  Debt  as well  as  that  of its  political  or administrative  subdivisions and  of any
entity  owned  or  controlled  by,  or  operating  for  the  account  or benefit  of, the  Member
Country  or  any  such  subdivision,  and  of any  institution  performing  the  functions  of a

-28-

Section 5.02.  Negative Pledge.

(a) 

If any Lien  is created  on any  Public Assets  as  security  for  any External
Debt, which will or might result in a priority for the benefit  of the creditor of such External
Debt  in  the  allocation,  realization  or  distribution  of  foreign  exchange  held  under  the
control  or for the benefit of the  Member  Country, such  Lien  shall, unless the World  Bank
shall  otherwise  agree,  ipso facto and  at  no  cost  to  the  World  Bank,  equally  and ratably
secure all Loan Payments, and the Member  Country, in creating or permitting the creation
of such  Lien,  shall  make  express provision  to  that effect;  provided,  however,  that  if for
any constitutional  or other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect to any
Lien  created  on  assets  of any of its  political  or  administrative  subdivisions,  the  Member
Country  shall promptly  and at no  cost to the World Bank  secure all Loan Payments  by an
equivalent  Lien on other  Public Assets satisfactory to the World  Bank.

(b) 

The Borrower which  is  not the Member  Country  undertakes  that,  except

as the World  Bank  shall otherwise  agree:

(i) 

if it creates  any Lien on any of its assets as  security for any debt,
such  Lien  will  equally  and ratably  secure  the  payment  of all  Loan Payments  and  in  the
creation  of any  such Lien express  provision  will be made  to  that  effect,  at  no cost  to the
World  Bank; and

(ii) 

if any  statutory Lien  is created on any of its assets  as security  for
any debt, it  shall grant at no cost to the World Bank, an equivalent  Lien  satisfactory to the
World Bank to secure the payment  of all Loan Payments.

(c) 

The provisions of paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this  Section shall not apply to:
(i)  any Lien created on property, at the time of purchase of such property, solely as security
for the  payment  of the purchase  price  of such  property or  as  security  for the payment  of
debt  incurred for the purpose  of financing  the purchase  of such  property;  or  (ii)  any  Lien
arising  in the  ordinary  course  of banking  transactions  and securing  a  debt  maturing  not
more than one year after the date on which  it is originally incurred.

ARTICLE VI

Section 6.02. 
Borrower, suspend the right  of the Borrower  to  make withdrawals  from the Loan Account

until the World  Bank  has  notified  the  Borrower  that  such  right  to  make  withdrawals  has
been restored.

-29-

(a) 

Payment Failure

(i) 

The  Borrower  has  failed  to make  payment  (notwithstanding  the
fact that  such payment may have been made by the  Guarantor or a third  party) of principal
or interest  or  any other  amount  due  to  IBRD or  IDA:  (A)  under  the Loan  Agreement;  or
(B)  under  any  other  agreement  between  the  Borrower  and  IBRD;  or  (C)  under  any
agreement  between  the  Borrower  and  IDA;  or  (D)  in  consequence  of  any  guarantee
extended  or  other  financial  obligation  of any kind  assumed  by  the  IBRD  or  IDA  to any
third party with the  agreement of the Borrower.

(ii) 

The Guarantor  has failed  to make payment  of principal or interest
or any other amount  due  to the IBRD or IDA:  (A)  under the  Guarantee Agreement;  or (B)
under any other agreement  between the Guarantor and IBRD;  or (C)  under  any agreement
between the Guarantor  and IDA;  or (D) in  consequence of any guarantee extended  or other
financial  obligation  of any  kind  assumed  by  IBRD  or  IDA  to  any  third  party  with  the
agreement  of the Guarantor.

(b) 

Performance Failure

The  Borrower  or  the  Guarantor  has  failed  to perform  any other
obligation  under  the  Legal  Agreement  to  which  it  is  a  party  or under  any  Derivatives
Agreement.

(i) 

obligation  under the  Project Agreement.

(ii) 

The  Project  Implementing  Entity  has  failed  to  perform  any

(c) 

Interference. If the  Loan  has  been  made  to  a  Borrower  which  is  not  the
Member  Country, the Member  Country  has:  (i)  taken or permitted  to be  taken any action
which would  prevent  or interfere  with  the execution  of the  Project or  the performance  by
the Borrower  of its  obligations  under  this  Agreement;  or (ii)  failed  to afford a reasonable
opportunity  for  representatives  of the  World  Bank  to  visit  any  part  of its  territory  for
purposes  related to  the Loan  or the  Project.

(d) 

Fraud and Corruption. At any time, the World  Bank  determines  that  any
representative  of the  Borrower or the Guarantor or the Project Implementing Entity  (or any
other  recipient  of  any  of the  proceeds  of the  Loan)  has  engaged  in  corrupt,  fraudulent,
coercive  or collusive  practices  in  connection  with  the  use  of the proceeds  of  the  Loan,
without  the  Borrower  or  the  Guarantor  or  the  Project  Implementing  Entity  (or any other
such recipient)  having taken timely and appropriate  action  satisfactory  to  the World  Bank
to  address  such practices  when they occur.

(e) 

Cross Suspension. IBRD  or  IDA  has  suspended  in whole  or  in part  the
right  of the  Borrower  or  the  Guarantor  to  make  withdrawals  under  any agreement  with
IBRD or with IDA because  of a failure  by the Borrower or  Guarantor to perform any of its
obligations  under  such agreement  or any other agreement  with IBRD or  IDA.

-30-

(f) 

Event Prior to Effectiveness.  The  World  Bank  has  determined  after  the
Effective  Date  that  prior  to  such date  but  after the  date  of this  Agreement,  an  event  has
occurred  that would have entitled the World Bank to suspend the  Borrower's  right to make
withdrawals  from the  Loan Account if this Agreement  had been  effective  on the date such
event occurred.

(g) 

Extraordinary Situation. As  a  result of events  which  have  occurred  after
the date of this Agreement, an extraordinary  situation has arisen which makes it improbable
that  the  Project  can  be  carried  out  or  that  the  Borrower,  the  Guarantor,  or  the  Project
Implementing  Entity will be able to perform  its obligations  under the Legal  Agreement  to
which it is  a party.

(h) 

Co-financing. Any  of the  following  events  occurs  with  respect  to  any
financing  specified  in the  Loan Agreement to be  provided for the Project ("Co-financing")
by  a financier  (other  than IBRD  or IDA)  ("Co-financier"):

(i) 

If the  Loan  Agreement  specifies  a date  by  which  the  agreement
with  the  Co-financier  providing  for  the  Co-financing  ("Co-financing  Agreement")  is  to
become effective, the Co-financing Agreement  has  failed to become effective  by that date,
or  such  later  date  as  the  World  Bank has  established  by  notice  to  the Borrower  and the
Guarantor  ("Co-financing  Deadline");  provided,  however,  that  the  provisions  of this  sub-
paragraph shall not apply if the Borrower  and the  Guarantor establish to the  satisfaction of
the  World  Bank  that  adequate  funds  for  the  Project  are  available  from  other  sources  on
terms  and  conditions  consistent  with  the  obligations  of the  Borrower  and  the  Guarantor
under the  Legal Agreements.

(ii) 

Subject  to  sub-paragraph  (iii)  of this  paragraph:  (A)  the  right  to
withdraw the  proceeds  of the Co-financing has  been suspended, canceled  or terminated in
whole  or  in  part,  pursuant  to  the  terms  of the  Co-financing  Agreement;  or (B)  the Co-
financing has  become due and payable prior to  its  agreed maturity.

(iii) 

Sub-paragraph  (ii)  of  this  paragraph  shall  not  apply  if  the
Borrower  and  the  Guarantor  establish  to  the  satisfaction  of the  Bank  that:  (A)  such
suspension,  cancellation,  termination  or  prematuring  was not  caused by  the failure  of the
recipient  of the  Co-financing  to  perform  any  of its  obligations  under  the  Co-financing
Agreement;  and  (B)  adequate  funds  for  the  Project  are  available  from  other  sources  on
terms  and  conditions  consistent  with  the  obligations  of the  Borrower  and  the  Guarantor
under the Legal  Agreements.

(i) 

Misrepresentation. A  representation  made  by  the  Borrower  or  the
Guarantor  in  or  pursuant  to  the  Legal  Agreements,  or  in  pursuant  to  any  Derivatives
Agreement,  or any representation  or statement  fumished by the Borrower  or the Guarantor
and  intended  to  be  relied  upon  by  the World  Bank  in making  the  Loan,  was  incorrect  in
any material  respect.

-31-

(j)

Project  Implementing Entity (or any other entity responsible  for implementing  any part of
the  Project)  has,  without  the  consent  of the  World  Bank:  (i) assigned  or transferred,  in
whole  or in  part,  any of its obligations  arising under or entered  into pursuant to the  Legal
Agreements;  or  (ii)  sold,  leased,  transferred,  assigned,  or  otherwise  disposed  of  any
property  or  assets  financed  wholly or in  part  out of the  proceeds  of the  Loan;  provided,
however, that  the provisions  of this  paragraph  shall not apply with respect  to transactions
in  the ordinary course  of business  which,  in the  opinion  of the World  Bank:  (A)  do  not
materially  and adversely  affect  the  ability  of the  Borrower  or  the  Project  Implementing
Entity (or such  other entity) to perform  any of its obligations  arising under or entered into
pursuant  to the Legal  Agreements  or to  achieve the  objectives  of the  Project;  and  (B)  do
not  materially  or  adversely  affect  the  financial  condition  or  operation  of the  Borrower

among its creditors.

(iii) 

Any action  has  been  taken  for the  dissolution,  disestablishment

of the Project).

(iv) 

The  Borrower  (other  than  the  Member  Country)  or the  Project
Implementing  Entity  (or  any  other  entity  responsible  for  implementing  any  part  of the
Project)  has  ceased  to exist  in the  same  legal  form  as  that prevailing  as of the  date  of the
Loan Agreement.

(v) 

In the opinion of the World Bank,  the  legal  character, ownership
or control  of the Borrower  (other than the  Member  Country)  or the  Project  Implementing
Entity  (or  of any  other  entity  responsible  for implementing  any part  of the  Project)  has
changed  from that prevailing as of the date  of the Legal  Agreements so as to materially and
adversely affect the  ability of the Borrower  or of the Project  Implementing Entity (or such

-32-

other  entity) to perform  any of its obligations  arising under or entered into pursuant  to the
Legal  Agreements,  or to achieve the  objectives of the Project.

(in)

financing  made  by  IBRD  or  IDA  or  otherwise  to  participate  in  the  preparation  or
implementation  of any.project  financed  in whole or in part by  IBRD or IDA,  as  a result of:
(i) a  determination  by  IBRD or  IDA  that the Borrower  or the  Project  Implementing  Entity
has  engaged  in  fraudulent, corrupt,  coercive  or collusive  practices  in connection  with the
use  of the proceeds  of any financing  made by  IBRD  or IDA;  and/or  (ii) a  declaration  by
another  financier  that  the  Borrower  or  the  Project  Implementing  Entity  is  ineligible  to
receive  proceeds of any financing made by such financier or otherwise  to participate  in the
preparation  or implementation  of any project  financed in whole or in part by such financier
as  a  result  of  a  determination  by  such  financier  that  the  Borrower  or  the  Project
Implementing  Entity  has engaged  in fraudulent,  corrupt,  coercive or collusive practices  in
connection  with the use  of the proceeds  of any financing made by  such financier.

respect  to  any  amount  of the  proceeds  of the  Loan,  that  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or
coercive  practices were engaged  in by representatives  of the Borrower  or the Guarantor  or
the  Project  Implementing  Entity  (or  any  other  recipient  of the  proceeds  of the  Loan),
without  the  Borrower  or  the  Guarantor  or  the  Project  Implementing  Entity  (or  other
recipient  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan)  having  taken  timely  and  appropriate  action
satisfactory to  the World  Bank  to address  such  practices  when they occur.

(d) 

Misprocurement. At  any  time,  the  World  Bank:  (i)  determines  that  the
procurement of any contract  to be  financed  out of the proceeds  of the  Loan is inconsistent
with  the  procedures  set  forth  or  referred  to  in  this  Agreement;  and  (ii)  establishes  the

-33-

the World Bank, by notice to  the World  Bank and the Borrower, terminate  its  obligations
under  the  Guarantee  Agreement  with  respect  to  any amount  of the  Unwithdrawn  Loan
Balance  as  at the  date  of receipt  of such notice  by  the  World  Bank;  provided  that  such

World Bank, such obligations in  respect of such amount  shall terminate.

Section  6.06.  Application of Cancelled Amounts to Maturities ofthe Loan. Except as the

be  entitled  in  any proceeding  under  this  Article  to  assert  any claim  that  any provision  of

any right,  power or remedy  accruing  to  any party  under any  Legal Agreement  upon  any

of such costs  shall be determined  by the Arbitral Tribunal.
