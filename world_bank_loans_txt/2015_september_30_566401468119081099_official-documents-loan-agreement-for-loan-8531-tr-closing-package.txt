Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  shall be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the extent  that  any proceeds  of the  Loan have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal Payment  Date, the Borrower  shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as
of such date in accordance  with paragraph  1 of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be repaid on
each  Principal  Payment  Date falling  after the  date of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by  the Bank by multiplying the amount  of each  such withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date, such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary, to  deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the purposes  solely  of calculating  the principal  amounts
payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date, be treated  as withdrawn  and outstanding
on the second Principal  Payment  Date  following the  date of withdrawal  and  shall

-15-

be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment Date  following  the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the Bank adopts a due date billing system  under which invoices are  issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no  longer apply to any  withdrawals made  after the adoption of such
billing system.

5. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in the
Approved  Currency  payable  by the Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if the  Bank  so determines  in  accordance  with the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange rate  component  of the  Screen Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this  Schedule shall  apply separately to the amount denominated  in each Loan
Currency, so  as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each  such amount.
