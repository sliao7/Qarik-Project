SCHEDULE  3

Amortization Schedule

1. 

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been fully
withdrawn as of the first  Principal Payment Date,  the principal amount of the  Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  by  (b) the  Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount to be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to
in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule, to  which a Currency Conversion  applies.

2. 

If the proceeds  of the  Loan have not been  fully  withdrawn  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal Payment Date shall  be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have  been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any

-16-

3. 

(a) 

amounts  referred  to in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn within two calendar  months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable on  any Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on 
following  the date  of withdrawal  and shall be  repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment  Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall  no longer apply to any  withdrawals made after
the  adoption of such billing  system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency Conversion  of all  or any portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion  by  either  (i) the  exchange  rate
that reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction relating to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in more  than one Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule shall  apply separately  to the  amount  denominated
in each  Loan  Currency, so  as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such amount.
