particular  attention. Critical  habitat includes  areas with high biodiversity value that
meet the criteria of the World  Conservation  Union (IUCN)  classification,  including
habitats  of significant  importance  for critically  endangered  or  endangered  species

importance  for  endemic  or  restricted-range  species;  habitats  supporting  globally
significant  concentrations  of migratory  species  and  /or congregator  species;  areas
with  unique  assemblages  of species  or which  are  associated  with key  evolutionary
processes.  Primary  forests  or  forests  of  High Conservation  Value  (HCV)  shall  be
