1. 
The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  Loan  A  and  the 
percentage  of the  total  principal amount  of  Loan  A payable on  each  Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of Loan A have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  Loan  A  repayable  by  the 
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2.  
If the proceeds of Loan A have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  Loan  A  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of Loan A have been withdrawn as of the 
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as of 
such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 
in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (“Original  Installment 
Share”)  and  the  denominator  of  which is the sum  of  all remaining  Original  Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable 
to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(a) 

3. 
Amounts of Loan A withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable 

16

on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 
 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency  Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 
on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be 
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate.  
 
5. 
If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
