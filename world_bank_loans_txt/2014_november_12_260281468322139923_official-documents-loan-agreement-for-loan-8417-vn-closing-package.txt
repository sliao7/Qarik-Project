not be used  in bid  evaluation.

A  contract  shall  be  awarded,  within  the  period  of the  validity  of bids,  to
the  bidder  who  meets  the  appropriate  standards  of  capability  and
resources  and  whose  bid  has  been  determined  (i)  to  be  substantially
responsive 
to  the  bidding  documents  and  (ii)  to  offer  the  lowest
evaluated  cost. No negotiations  shall  be permitted.  A  bidder  shall neither
be  required  nor  permitted,  as  a  condition  for  award,  to  undertake
in  the  bidding  documents  or  otherwise  to
obligations  not  specified

No  bid  shall  be  eliminated  from  detailed  evaluation  on  the  basis  of

criteria,  or the  bid  price  of the  lowest  evaluated  winning  bid  is  substantially  higher  than
the  Borrower's  updated  estimated  cost or available  budget. Lack  of competition  shall  not
be  determined  solely  on  the  basis  of the  number  of bidders.  Even  when  only  one  bid  is
submitted,  the  bidding  process  may  be  considered  valid,  if the  bid  was  satisfactorily
advertised,  the  qualification  criteria were  not unduly  restrictive,  and prices  are reasonable
in  comparison  to  market  values.  All  bids  shall  not  be  rejected  or  new  bids  solicited
without  the Bank's prior written  agreement.

Complaints by  Bidders and  Handling  of Complaints

11. 
The  Borrower  shall  implement  an  effective  and  independent  protest  mechanism
allowing  bidders  to  protest  and  have  their  protests  handled  in  a  timely  manner.  An
independent  protest  mechanism  shall  provide  for  the  review  of  complaints  by  an
independent  entity  that  is  not  involved  in  any  aspect  of  the  underlying  procurement
process (e.g.,  bid evaluation,  contract approval,  etc.).

Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")

Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that is
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its
currency  of denomination  immediately  prior to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i) the
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the
Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than one  Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated
in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for
each  such  amount.
