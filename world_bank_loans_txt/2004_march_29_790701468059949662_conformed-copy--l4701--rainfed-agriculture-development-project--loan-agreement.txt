SCHEDULE 3 
 
Amortization Schedule 
 

1. 
The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying:  
(a)  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  as  of  the  first 
Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date, 
such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 
 

 

 
 
 

Payment Date

On each February 1 and August 1 
Beginning August 1, 2009 
through August 1, 2020 

On February 1, 2021 

Installment Share 
(Expressed as a %)

4.17% 

4.09% 

 
2.  
If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  not  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

 
(a) 

 
(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of  the first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  amount  withdrawn  and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, 
the  numerator  of  which  shall  be  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in 
paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original  Installment 
Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such repayment amounts 
to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(a) 

Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
3. 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on 
any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 

- 15 - 

Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following 
the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if 
at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph 
shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  
 
4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall 
be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  said  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the 
amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in 
accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate  component  of  the  Screen 
Rate.  
 
5. 
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall  be  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce 
a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

For  withdrawals  of  the  Authorized  Allocation,  the  Borrower,  through 
EHCAAN,  shall  furnish  to  the  Bank  a  request  or  requests  for  deposit  into  the  Special 
Account  of  an  amount  or  amounts  which  do  not  exceed  the  aggregate  amount  of  the

deposit  into  the  Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower, 
through  EHCAAN,  shall  have  requested  and  as  shall  have  been 
shown  by  said  documents  and  other  evidence  to  have  been  paid

the audit reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account; 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention to 
suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan 
Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 
 

(d) 

once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible 
Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by 
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of 
twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
 
Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of the  remaining  unwithdrawn amount  of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall 
specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 
to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that  all  such  amounts  remaining  on

payments for eligible expenditures. 
 
6. 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph  2  of  this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was  not  justified  by  the  evidence  furnished  to  the 
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if 
the  Bank  shall  so  request,  refund  to  the  Bank)  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  such 
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise 

(a) 

- 18 - 

agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the  Bank  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  until  the 
Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

 
(b) 

 
(c) 

 
(d) 

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank 
such outstanding amount. 

The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 

portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6(a), (b) and (c) of this 
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  this  Agreement,  including  the 
General Conditions.
