1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:

     (a)  the term "eligible Category" means Category (1) (a) set forth
in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

     (b)  the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect
of the reasonable cost of works required for the Project and to be

the eligible Category in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement; and

     (c)  the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount to be with-
drawn from the Loan Account and deposited in Special Accounts A pursuant

DEM 3,340,000 for the DEM Special Account A (to be withdrawn from the

wise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount
equivalent to $1,000,000 for the Dollar Special Account A and DEM

the equivalent of $7,500,000 and DEM 11,000,000, respectively.

2.   Payments out of the Special Accounts A shall be made exclusively

A shall be made as follows:

     (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or
deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized
Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall,
on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
into such Special Account A such amount or amounts as the Borrower
shall have requested.

     (b)  (i)  For replenishment of such Special Account A, the Borrower

               shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into such
               respective Special Account A at such intervals as the
               Bank shall specify.

         (ii)  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
               Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and
               other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of
               this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect
               of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of
               each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
               Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
               into such respective Special Account A such amount
               as the Borrower shall have requested and as shall
               have been shown by said documents and other evidence
               to have been paid out of the respective Special
               Account A for eligible expenditures.

lent amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other
evidence.

the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request,
furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that
such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into a Special
Account A:

     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

     (b)  if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank
within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this
Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the
Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records
and accounts for the Special Account A;

     (c)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

     (d)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan Tranche
allocated to the eligible Category minus the total amount of all
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant
to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the
Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the
Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Category shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the respective Special Account A as

eligible expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of any Special Account A: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule;
or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into such
Special Account A (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the
Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion
thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise

agree, no further deposit by the Bank into such Special Account A
shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in any Special Account A will not be required to cover
further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank
all or any portion of the funds on deposit in any Special Account A.

and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.

$750,000 equivalent from the DEM Loan Tranche), provided, however, that

to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed
the equivalent of $4,500,000.

shall be made as follows:

     (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or

     (b)  (i)  For replenishment of Special Account B, the Borrower

               this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect
               of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of
               each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
               Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
               into Special Account B such amount as the Borrower
               shall have requested and as shall have been shown by

     (d)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of each Loan Tranche
allocated to the eligible Categories minus the total amount of all
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant
to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the respective Special Account B as
of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for
eligible expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any

Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion
thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into Special Account B shall be
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such
deposit or refund, as the case may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in Special Account B will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon  notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such out-

standing amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
