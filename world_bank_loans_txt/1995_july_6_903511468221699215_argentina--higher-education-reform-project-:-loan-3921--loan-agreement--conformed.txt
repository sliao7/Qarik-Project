Credits" published  by the Bank in May  1992  (the Guidelines),  and  in accordance  with the
following  additional  procedures:

(a) 

When  contract  award  is delayed beyond  the original  bid  validity period,
such  period  may  be  extended  once,  subject  to  and  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
paragraph  2.59  of the Guidelines,  by the minimum amount  of time  required  to  complete
the evaluation,  obtain  necessary approvals and clearances  and award the  contract.  The bid
validity  period  may  be  extended  a  second  time  only  if the  bidding  documents  or the
request  for extension  shall  provide  for  appropriate  adjustment  of the  bid  price  to  reflect
changes  in  the  cost  of inputs  for  the  contract  over  the  period  of extension.  Such  an
increase  in  the  bid  price  shall  not  be  taken  into  account  in  the  bid  evaluation.  With
respect  to each  contract  made  subject to  the Bank's prior review  in  accordance  with the
provisions  of Part  D.1  (a) of this Section,  the Bank's prior approval  will be required  for:
(i) a first extension of the bid validity period  if the period of extension exceeds  sixty (60)
days;  and  (ii)  any  subsequent  extension  of the  bid  validity period.

(b) 

In the procurement  of goods in accordance with this Part A,  the Borrower
shall  use  the  relevant  standard  bidding  documents  issued  by  the  Bank,  with  such
modifications  thereto  as the  Bank  shall  have  agreed  to  be  necessary  for  the  purposes  of
the  Project.  Where  no  relevant  standard  bidding  documents  have  been  issued  by  the
Bank, the Borrower  shall use bidding documents based on other internationally  recognized
standard  forms  agreed  with  the Bank.

2. 

To  the  extent  practicable,  contracts  for  goods  shall  be  grouped  into  bid

packages  estimated  to  cost the  equivalent  of $350,000  or more.

Part  B: 

Preference  for Domestic  Manufacturers

In the procurement  of goods in accordance  with  the procedures  described  in Part
A. 1 hereof,  goods manufactured  in Argentina  may  be  granted  a margin  of preference  in

- 20  -

accordance  with,  and  subject  to,  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  2.55  and  2.56  of  the

accordance  with the procedures  set forth  in Sections  I and II  of the Guidelines  (excluding
paragraphs  2.8, 2.9,  2.55  and 2.56 thereof).  The Borrower,  through  the PIU,  shall submit
this  list to  the  Bank for  approval  before  inviting  bids.

equivalent  of  $350,000  or  less  per  contract,  up  to  an  aggregate  amount  equivalent  to
$700,000,  may  be  procured  under  contracts  awarded  on the basis  of comparison  of price

"Guidelines for the Use  of Consultants by World  Bank Borrowers  and  by the World Bank
as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August  1981  (the Consultant Guidelines).
For complex,  time-based assignments, the Borrower  shall  employ  such consultants  under
contracts  using the  standard  form  of contract for consultants'  services issued by the Bank,
with  such  modifications  as  shall  have  been  agreed  by  the  Bank.  Where  no  relevant
standard  contract  documents  have been  issued  by the  Bank,  the Borrower  shall  use  other
standard  forms  agreed  with  the Bank.  For  all  other  assignments,  the Borrower  shall use
or  cause  to  be used  the  standard  letter  of invitation  and  contract  transmitted  to  the Bank
by the  Borrower  under  the letter  dated  June  30,  1995.

firms  raising  the contract  value  to  $100,000  equivalent  or  above;  or  (e)  amendments  to

Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited  to  an  amount
equivalent  to  $5,000,000  until  the  aggregate  amount  of withdrawals  from  the  Loan
Account  plus the total  amount of all  outstanding special  commitments entered  into  by the
Bank  pursuant to  Section  5.02  of the  General  Conditions  shall  be  equal  to or  exceed  the
equivalent  of $30,000,000.

2. 

Payments  out  of  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  exclusively  for

eligible  expenditures  in  accordance  with  the provisions  of this  Schedule.

withdrawals  to  replenish the  Special  Account  shall be  made  as follows:

For withdrawals  of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower  shall furnish
to  the  Bank  a  request  or  requests  for  a  deposit  or  deposits  which  do  not  exceed  the
aggregate  amount  of the  Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of such request  or requests,

(b) 

(i) 

For  replenishment  of the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall

- 24  -

pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule  for  the  payment  or

the basis  of each  such request,  the Bank  shall,  on  behalf of the
Borrower,  withdraw  from  the Loan  Account  and  deposit  into
the  Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have
requested  and  as  shall  have  been  shown  by  said  documents  and

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraph  3  of this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall

5. 
not  be required  to  make  further  deposits  into  the  Special  Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the Bank  shall have determined  that all further  withdrawals
should be made  by  the Borrower  directly  from  the Loan  Account  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of Article  V  of the  General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a)  of Section 2.02  of
this  Agreement;  or

required  to be furnished to the Bank pursuant  to  said Section  in  respect of the audit  of the
records  and  accounts  for  the  Special  Account;

(c) 

if,  at any time, the Bank  shall have  notified the Borrower  of its  intention
to  suspend  in  whole  or  in  part  the  right  of the  Borrower  to  make withdrawals  from  the
Loan  Account  pursuant to the  provisions  of Section  6.02  of the General  Conditions;  or

(d) 

once  the total  unwithdrawn  amount  of the  Loan  allocated  to  the eligible
Categories,  less the  amount  of any  outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by  the
Bank pursuant to  Section 5.02 of the General  Conditions with respect  to the  Project,  shall
equal  the  equivalent  of twice  the  amount  of the  Authorized  Allocation.

amount  of the Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as

- 25  -

the Bank shall  specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further  withdrawals  shall be made
only after  and  to  the  extent that the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that all  such  amounts
remaining  on deposit  in the  Special  Account as  of the date  of such  notice will  be utilized
in  making  payments  for  eligible  expenditures.

(a)  If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of the
6. 
Special  Account:  (i)  was made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible  pursuant
to paragraph  2  of this  Schedule;  or (ii)  was  not justified  by the  evidence  furnished  to the
the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from 
additional  evidence  as the Bank may  request;  or (B)  deposit  into the Special  Account (or,
if  the  Bank  shall  so  request, refund  to  the Bank)  an  amount  equal to the  amount  of such
payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit by  the  Bank  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made
until  the Borrower  has provided  such evidence  or made such deposit or refund,  as the case
may  be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined  at any time that any amount outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures,  the Borrower  shall, promptly upon notice  from the Bank, refund to the Bank
such  outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or

any  portion  of the  funds  on  deposit  in  the  Special  Account.

(d) 

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs  6 (a),  (b) and (c)  of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with the  relevant  provisions  of this  Agreement,  including  the
General  Conditions.
