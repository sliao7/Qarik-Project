the  Borrower  to  make  withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  pursuant  to  Section  6.02  of 
the  General  Conditions.    Upon  such  notification,  the  Bank  shall  determine,  in  its  sole

from the Bank, provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request, or deposit into 
the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal

by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such

For the purposes of this Annex, the term “Authorized Allocation” means: (i) an 
amount  of  $600,000  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the 
Borrower’s central bank for Special Account A; and (ii) an amount of $1,400,000 to be 
withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the  Borrower’s  central  bank  for 
Special Account B, all pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Annex.

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to  the  Bank  a  request  or  requests  for  deposit  into  the  relevant  Special  Accounts  of  an 
amount or amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed the Authorized Allocation.  On 
the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from 
the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower 
shall have requested.  

(b) 

 
For  replenishment  of  the  relevant  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposit into the Special Account at such intervals as the 
Bank  shall  specify.    Prior  to  or  at  the  time  of  each  such  request,  the  Borrower  shall

replenishment is requested.  On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf 
of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account 
such amount as the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said 
documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for Eligible 
Expenditures.  Each  such  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  withdrawn  by  the 
Bank from the Loan Account under one or more of the Eligible Categories. 

The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the relevant Special 
3.

outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the 
General  Conditions  shall  equal  the  equivalent  of  twice  the  amount  of  the  Authorized 
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 

- 23 –

amount of the Loan shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 
the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that 
the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that  all  such  amounts  remaining  on  deposit  in  the 
Special  Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for 
Eligible Expenditures.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

 
1. 
The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying: (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 
the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 
Date,  such  repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2. 
If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  not  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

 
(b) 

Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original 
Installment  Share)  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 
 
3. 
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 

(a) 

- 28 –

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal. 

 
(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if  at  any  time  the  Bank  shall adopt  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which invoices  are 
issued  on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of  such 
billing system.  
 
4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period, 
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate. 
 
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
5. 
shall  be  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule 
shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
