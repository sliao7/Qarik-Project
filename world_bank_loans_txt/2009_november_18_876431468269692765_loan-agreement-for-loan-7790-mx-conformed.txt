LOAN AGREEMENT 
 
Agreement  dated  November  18,  2009,  entered  into  between  United  Mexican  States, 
represented  by  its  signatory  on  page  6  of  this  Agreement  (“Borrower”)  and 
INTERNATIONAL  BANK  FOR  RECONSTRUCTION  AND  DEVELOPMENT 
(“Bank”) for the purpose of providing financing in support of the Program (as defined in 
the Appendix to this Agreement).  The Bank has decided to provide this financing on the 
basis,  inter  alia, of:  (a)  the  actions  which  the  Borrower  has  already  taken  under  the 
Program and which are described in Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) 
the Borrower’s maintenance of an appropriate macro-economic policy framework.   
 
Whereas the Borrower has informed the Bank that the proceeds of the Loan (as set forth 
in the table in Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement and for purposes of supporting 
the  Program),  shall  be  used  in  conformity  with  the  requirements  of  the  Borrower’s 
income, budgetary and public debt laws and the terms of this Agreement, the Borrower 
and the Bank hereby agree as follows: 

 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 
 
1.01.  The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement) 

constitute an integral part of this Agreement. 

 
1.02.  Unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  the  capitalized  terms  used  in  this 
Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in 
the Appendix to this Agreement. 

 
ARTICLE II — LOAN 
 
2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or 
referred to in this Agreement, the amount of one billion five hundred and three 
million  seven  hundred  and  fifty  thousand  Dollars  ($1,503,750,000),  as  such 
amount may be converted from time to time through a Currency Conversion in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  As a consequence of the Borrower’s maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic 
policy  framework  and  its  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Program,  the 
Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance with Section II 
of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. The Borrower’s Representatives for purposes of 
taking any action required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Section are 
the  Director  General  of  BANSEFI  or  the  Director  General  Adjunto  de  Banca 

2

Institucional  of BANSEFI  or  any  person  or  persons  whom  such  representative 
shall jointly or severally designate in writing. 

2.03.  The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of one 

percent (0.25%) of the Loan amount.   

 
2.04.  The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate 
equal to LIBOR for the Loan Currency plus the Variable Spread; provided, that 
upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the 
interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on such amount 
shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of 
the  General  Conditions.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the 
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains  unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment 
continues for a period of thirty days, then the interest payable by the Borrower 
shall  instead  be  calculated  as  provided  in  Section  3.02  (d)  of  the  General 
Conditions. 

 
2.05.  The Payment Dates are April 15 and October 15 in each year.

of the terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: 
(i) a change of the Loan Currency of all or any portion of the principal 
amount  of  the  Loan,  withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved 
Currency; (ii) a change of the interest rate basis applicable to all or any 
portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding 
from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice versa; and (iii) the setting 
of  limits  on  the  Variable  Rate  applicable  to  all  or  any  portion  of  the 
principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  by  the 
establishment  of  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or  Interest  Rate  Collar  on  the

is accepted by the Bank shall be considered a “Conversion”, as defined 
in the General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the 
provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion 
Guidelines.  

Promptly  following  the  Execution  Date  for  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or 
Interest  Rate  Collar  for  which  the  Borrower  has  requested  that  the 
premium  be  paid  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan,  the  Bank  shall,  on 
behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to 
itself  the  amounts  required  to  pay  any  premium  payable  in  accordance 
with  Section  4.05  (c)  of  the  General  Conditions  up  to  the  amount
