the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank
shall  specify  by  notice  to  the  Borrower.  Such  further withdrawals  shall be  made  only

If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the
Special Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible pursuant
to  paragraph  2  of  this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was  not  justified  by  the  evidence  furnished
to  the  Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional  evidence  as  the  Bank  may  request;  or  (B)  deposit  into  the  Special  Account
(or,  if  the  Bank  shall  so  request,  refund  to  the  Bank)  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount
of  such payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank
shall  otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the  Bank  into  the  Special Account  shall
be  made  until  the  Borrower has  provided  such evidence  or  made  such deposit  or  refund,
as  the  case  may  be.

(b) 

If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined at  any  time  that  any  amount  outstanding

in  the  Special  Account will  not  be  required to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund to  the
Bank  such  outstanding  amount.

(c)

(d) 

Refunds  to  the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of

this  Schedule  shall be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  this  Agreement,  including
the  General  Conditions.
