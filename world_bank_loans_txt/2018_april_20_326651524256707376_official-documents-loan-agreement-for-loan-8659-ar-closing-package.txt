Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower on
(a)
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:

To  the  extent  that  any proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as
of such date in  accordance  with paragraph  1  of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall be  repaid  on

Amounts  of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts

-18-

on the  second Principal  Payment  Date following  the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal Payment  Date following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the  Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on

paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date occurring during the Conversion  Period, shall  be determined  by the  Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by the Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule  shall apply separately to the amount  denominated  in each Loan
Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each such amount.
