Amortization  Schedule

The following table  sets  forth the Principal  Payment Dates of the Loan  and the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have been fully  withdrawn  as  of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the Loan  repayable  by  the Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by 
the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a) Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the first Principal  Payment Date;  by (b)  the  Installment
Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such repayable amount  to be adjusted,  as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
