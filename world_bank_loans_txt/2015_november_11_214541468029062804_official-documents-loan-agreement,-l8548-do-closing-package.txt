have  the  meanings  ascribed  to  them  in  the  General  Conditions  or in  the  Appendix
to this Agreement.

ARTICLE  II - LOAN

2.01. 

The Bank agrees  to  lend  to the  Borrower,  on the terms  and  conditions  set  forth or
referred  to  in  this Agreement,  the  amount  of sixty  million  Dollars  ($60,000,000),
as  such  amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time  through  a  Currency
Conversion  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Section  2.08  of this Agreement
("Loan").

2.02.  The Borrower  may  withdraw the  proceeds  of the  Loan  in  support  of the  Program

in  accordance  with  Section II  of Schedule  I  to this Agreement.

2.03. 

The Front-end  Fee  payable  by the  Borrower  shall  be  equal  to  one  quarter  of one
percent (0.25%)  of the  Loan amount.

2.04.  The Commitment  Charge payable  by the Borrower  shall be  equal to one quarter of

one  percent  (0.25%)  per annum  on  the Unwithdrawn  Loan  Balance.

2.05.  The  interest  payable  by  the  Borrower  for  each  Interest  Period  shall  be  at  a rate
equal to the Reference Rate  for the Loan Currency  plus the Fixed Spread;  provided,
that  upon  a  Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  principal  amount  of the  Loan,
the  interest payable  by the Borrower during the Conversion  Period on such  amount
shall be determined  in accordance  with the relevant  provisions of Article IV of the
General  Conditions.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains  unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment
continues  for a  period  of thirty  days,  then  the  interest  payable  by  the  Borrower

If the  proceeds  of the Loan  have not been  fully  withdrawn  as  of the first  Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment Date  shall be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any  proceeds  of the Loan  have been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to which  a  Currency
Conversion applies.

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within  two calendar  months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall  be repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the  date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date  billing system  under which  invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption  of such  billing  system.

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any  Principal Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the  Conversion by  either:  (a)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to  the  Conversion;  or (b)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan  Currency,
the  provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the  amount  denominated
in  each  Loan Currency,  so as  to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
