of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first
Principal  Payment Date,  the principal  amount of the Loan  repayable  by the Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment
Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to  deduct  any amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

(b) 

To the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance as
of such  date  in accordance  with paragraph  I of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment Date  shall  be repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date falling  after the date  of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the Bank by multiplying  the amount of each such withdrawal  by a
fraction,  the nunierator  of which  is the original  Installment Share  specified  in  the
table  in  paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted, as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two  calendar months prior to  any Principal
Payment  Date shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the principal  amounts
payable  on any Principal  Payment  Date, be  treated  as withdrawn  and outstanding
on the second Principal  Payment Date  following  the date of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal Payment Date  following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if  at  any
time the  Bank adopts  a due  date billing system  under which  invoices are issued  on

-17-

or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding the provisions  of paragraphs  I  and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a Currency
Conversion  of all or any  portion of the Withdrawn Loan  Balance to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion  Period, shall be determined by  the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency payable  by the Bank  under the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with the  Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange  rate component of the  Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan
Currency, so  as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for  each such amount.
