Procurement of Goods and Works Part A: International Competitive Bidding 1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works for the Project shall be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines). (a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity period, the successful bidder’s bid price will be increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign currency components and the other to the local currency component of the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. (b) In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with this Part A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the Bank. 2. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods and works for Part B.4 of the Project shall be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $3,000,000 or more.   Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers and Regional Manufacturers 1. For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the supply of goods: (a) bidders shall be required to state in their bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the ex- factory price for domestically-manufactured goods; (b) customs duties and other import taxes on imported goods, and sales and similar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded; and    - 26 - (c) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight and other expendi- tures incidental to the delivery of goods to the place of their use or installation shall be included. 2. For goods manufactured in Jamaica and in member countries of CARICOM, the Borrower may grant a margin of preference in accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions: (a) All bidding documents shall clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the information required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such preference and the following methods and stages that will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids. (b) After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the following groups: (i) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Jamaica if the bidder shail have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes a value added in Jamaica equal to at least 20% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. (ii) Group B: all other bids offering goods from within Jamaica. (iii) Group C: bids offering goods manufactured in a country other than Jamaica which is a party to CARICOM and entitled to preferential tariffs thereunder. (iv) Group D: bids offering any other goods. (c) All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import taxes on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes on goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group. The lowest evaluated bid of each group shall then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award.            ~ 27 - (d) If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c) above, the lowest evaluated bid is a bid from group C or group D, all group C and group D bids shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group A after adding to the evaluated bid price of the imported goods offered in each group C and group D bid, for the purpose of this further comparison only, an amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the amount of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such group C or group D bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said customs duties and taxes exceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid or a group C bid is the lowest in such further comparison, it shall be selected for the award. (e) If, as a result of the further comparison under paragraph (d) above, a bid from group D is the lowest, all group D bids shall be finally compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group C, as determined under paragraph (c) above, after adding to the evaluated bid price of goods to be imported offered in each group D bid, for the purpose of this final comparison only, an. amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the difference between the amount of customs duties and other import taxes which would actually be payable for the importation of goods offered in such group D bid and for the importation of goods offered in the group C bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of goods to be imported offered in such group D bid. If the lowest bid in such comparison is the group C bid, it shall be selected for purposes of award; if not, the lowest evaluated bid from group D, as determined under paragraph (c) above, shall be selected for purposes of award. 3. For purposes of this Schedule "CARICOM" means the Caribbean Common Market created by the General Treaty for the Caribbean Community signed at Chaguaramas, Trinidad and Tobago, on July 4, 1970 by Anguilla, Antigua, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.

Where payments for such contract are to be made out of the Special Account, such procedures shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment out of the Special Account in respect of such contract. (b) With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of the Special Account, said procedures shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract together with the other information required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement. (c) The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals are to be made on the basis of statements of expenditure. 2.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to contracts estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent each. However, this exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to the terms of reference for such contracts or to the employment of individuals, to single source selection of firms, to assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank or to amendments of contracts raising the contract value to $50,000 equivalent or above.      ~ 30 - SCHEDULE 5 Special Account 1.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date          - 32 - of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures. 6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.
