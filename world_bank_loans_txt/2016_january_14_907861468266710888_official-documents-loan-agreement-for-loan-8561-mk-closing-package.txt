The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment Date ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal  Payment Date, the principal amount  of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower  on each Principal  Payment Date shall  be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share  for each Principal Payment Date,  such
repayable  amount  to be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct any  amounts  referred to
in  paragraph 4  of this  Schedule,  to which a  Currency  Conversion applies.

each Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds  of the  Loan have been withdrawn as  of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan withdrawn  within two calendar  months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date  of withdrawal  and  shall be  repayable  on each Principal

16

Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are  issued on or after the respective Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall  no longer apply to any withdrawals made  after
the adoption  of such  billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion by either:  (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
the  Bank  so  determines 
exchange  rate  component of the  Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance is  denominated  in more than  one  Loan Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately to  the amount  denominated
in each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a  separate amortization  schedule  for each
such amount.
