                              Special Account

1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:

     (a)  the term "eligible Categories" means for the NIA Special
Account, Categories 4, 5 and 6 (collectively the NIA Categories) and
for the DENR Special Account, Categories 1, 2 and 3 (collectively
the DENR Categories), all as set forth in the table in paragraph 1

Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the said Special
Account shall be made as follows:

     (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into
said Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis
of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into said
Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have
requested.

     (b)  (i)  For replenishment of said Special Account, the Borrower
               shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into
               said Special Account at such intervals as the Bank
               shall specify.

         (ii)  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
               Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and
               other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of
               this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect
               of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of
               each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
               Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
               into said Special Account such amount as the Borrower
               shall have requested and as shall have been shown by
               said documents and other evidence to have been paid
               out of said Special Account for eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account
under the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective
equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents
and other evidence.

4.   For each payment made by the Borrower out of a Special Account,
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request,
furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that
such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into a
Special Account:

     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from
the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of
the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement;

     (b)  if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,
within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of
this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished
to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the
records and accounts for said Special Account;

     (c)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

     (d)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to said Categories,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-

drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the said Special Account as of the
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for
eligible expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of a Special Account:

          (i)  was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
               eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or

         (ii)  was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
               Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from
               the Bank:

               (A)  provide such additional evidence as the Bank
                    may request; or

               (B)  deposit into said Special Account (or, if the
                    Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an
                    amount equal to the amount of such payment or
                    the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.

Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank
into said Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has
provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in a Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank
such outstanding amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in a Special Account.

     (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
