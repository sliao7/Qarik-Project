Any amount withdrawn  after the first  Principal Payment  Date shall  be repaid  on  each
Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the

Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on
the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall  be
repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal
Payment Date  following  the date  of withdrawal.

(b)

the  Bank  adopts  a due  date  billing system under which invoices  are  issued  on or  after
the respective  Principal  Payment Date,  the provisions  of such sub-paragraph  shall  no
longer  apply to  any withdrawals  made  after the adoption of such billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all  or any  portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an  Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be determined  by the  Bank  by
multiplying  such  amount 
in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by the  Bank under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to
the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan
Currency,  so as to produce  a  separate  amortization schedule  for  each such  amount.
