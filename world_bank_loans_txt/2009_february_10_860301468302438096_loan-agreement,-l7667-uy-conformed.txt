LOAN NUMBER 7667-UR 
 

LOAN AGREEMENT 
 
Agreement  dated  February  10,  2009,  entered  into  between  REPÚBLICA  ORIENTAL  DEL 
URUGUAY  (“Borrower”)  and  INTERNATIONAL  BANK  FOR  RECONSTRUCTION  AND 
DEVELOPMENT (“Bank”) for the purpose of providing financing in support of the Program (as 
defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).  The Bank has decided to provide this financing on 
the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions which the Borrower has already taken under the Program 
and  which  are  described  in  Section  I  of  Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement;  and  (b)  the  Borrower’s 
maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework.  The Borrower and the Bank 
therefore hereby agree as follows: 

 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 
 
1.01.  The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement)  constitute  an 

integral part of this Agreement. 

 
1.02.  Unless the context requires otherwise, the capitalized terms used in this Agreement have 
the  meanings  ascribed  to  them  in  the  General  Conditions  or  in  the  Appendix  to  this 
Agreement. 

 
ARTICLE II — LOAN 
 
2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or referred 
to in this Agreement, the amount of $400,000,000 (four hundred million Dollars), as such 
amount  may  be  converted  from  time  to  time  through  a  Currency  Conversion  in 
accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.07 and 2.08 of this Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  The  Borrower  may  withdraw  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  in  support  of  the  Program  in 

accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. 

2.03.  The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of one percent 
(0.25%) of the Loan amount.  The Borrower shall pay the Front-end Fee not later than 
sixty days after the Effective Date. 

 
2.04.  The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate equal to 
LIBOR  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Variable  Spread;  provided,  that  upon  a 
Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the interest payable 
by  the  Borrower  during  the  Conversion  Period  on  such  amount  shall  be  determined  in 
accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions.  
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains 
unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment  continues  for  a  period  of  thirty  days,  then  the 
interest payable by the Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 
(d) of the General Conditions. 

 
2.05.  The Payment Dates are February 15 and August 15 in each year. 

2.06. 

(a) 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  paragraph  (b)  of  this  Section,  the  principal 
amount of the Loan shall be repaid in accordance with the amortization schedule 
set forth in Schedule 2 to this Agreement. 

 
(a) 

2.07. 

(b) 

The Borrower may at the time of requesting a Withdrawal also request repayment 
provisions different from those set out in Schedule 2 to this Agreement for such 
Withdrawal, provided that: (i) the average maturity of such Withdrawal does not 
exceed  18  years  from  the  Withdrawal  Date  and  the  final  maturity  of  such 
Withdrawal does not exceed 30 years from the Withdrawal Date (or such other 
average  maturity  and/or  final  maturity  as  may  be  generally  applicable  to  loans 
made by the Bank to the Borrower at the time of such agreement); and (ii) such 
repayment provisions have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank prior 
to the Withdrawal Date of any such Withdrawal. 

Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08 of this Agreement, the Borrower may 
at any time request any of the following Conversions of the terms of the Loan in 
order to facilitate prudent debt management: (i) a change of the Loan Currency of 
all  or  any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan,  withdrawn  or 
unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved  Currency;  (ii)  a  change  of  the  interest  rate  basis 
applicable to  all or  any  portion  of the principal  amount  of the  Loan  withdrawn 
and outstanding from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice versa; and (iii) the 
setting  of  limits  on  the  Variable  Rate  applicable  to  all  or  any  portion  of  the 
principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding by the establishment of 
an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate Collar on the Variable Rate. 

(b) 

Any  conversion  requested  pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of  this  Section  that  is 
accepted  by  the  Bank  shall  be  considered  a  “Conversion”,  as  defined  in  the 
General  Conditions,  and  shall  be  effected  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion Guidelines.  

 
2.08.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Article II of this Agreement or Article 
III of the General Conditions, the Borrower may request that an amount withdrawn from 
the  Loan  Account  shall  be  converted  into  Uruguayan  Pesos  (“UYU”)  through  the 
issuance  by  the  Bank  of  UYU  bonds  in  connection  with  such  conversion  (the  “UYU 
Notes”).  Such withdrawn amount shall accrue interest, and the principal amount thereof 
shall be repayable, in each case exclusively on such terms and conditions as the Borrower 
and the Bank may separately agree, subject always to the Bank’s determination in its sole 
discretion that it can issue the UYU Notes for such amount on reasonable terms. 

 
2.09.  Without  limitation  upon  the  provisions  of  Section  5.10  of  the  General  Conditions,  the 
Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Bank such information relating to the provisions 
of this Article II as the Bank may, from time to time, reasonably request.

ARTICLE III — PROGRAM 

 
3.01.  The Borrower declares its commitment to the Program and its implementation.  To this 

end, and further to Section 5.08 of the General Conditions: 

the Borrower and the Bank shall from time to time, at the request of either party, 
exchange  views  on  the  progress  achieved  in  carrying  out  the  Program  and  the 
actions specified in Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; 

prior to each such exchange of views, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank for 
its  review  and  comment  a  report  on  the  progress  achieved  in  carrying  out  the 
Program, in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request; and 

without limitation upon the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section, 
the Borrower shall promptly inform the Bank of any situation which would have 
the  effect  of  materially  reversing  the  objectives  of  the  Program  or  any  action 
taken under the Program including any action specified in Section I of Schedule 
1 to this Agreement. 

ARTICLE IV — REMEDIES OF THE BANK 
 

4.01.  The Additional Events of Suspension consist of the following: 
 

A  situation  has  arisen  which  shall  make  it  improbable  that  the  Program,  or  a 
significant part of it, will be carried out. 

The Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework has become inconsistent with 
the objectives of the Program. 

An action has been taken or a policy has been adopted to reverse any action or 
policy under the Program (including any action listed in Section I of Schedule 1 
to this Agreement) in a manner that would, in the opinion of the Bank, adversely 
affect the achievement of the objectives of the Program. 

ARTICLE V — TERMINATION 

5.01.  Without prejudice to the provisions of the General Conditions, the Effectiveness Deadline 
is the date ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement, but in no case later than the

Withdrawal  of  Loan  Proceeds.    If,  at  any  time  prior  to  the  receipt  by  the  Bank  of  a 
request for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, the Bank determines that a review of 
the  Borrower’s  macroeconomic  policy  framework  or  of  its  progress  in  carrying  out  the 
Program is warranted, the Bank shall give notice to the Borrower to that effect.  Upon the 
giving of such notice, no withdrawals shall be made of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance 
unless and until the Bank has notified the Borrower of its satisfaction, after an exchange 
of views as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 3.01 of this Agreement, with: 
(1)  the  progress  achieved  by  the  Borrower  in  carrying  out  the  Program;  and  (2)  the 
appropriateness of the Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework. 

Deposits of Loan Amounts.  Except as the Bank may otherwise agree:

all  withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  shall  be  deposited  by  the  Bank  into  an 
account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank; and 

the Borrower shall ensure that upon each deposit of an amount of the Loan into 
this  account,  an  equivalent  amount  is  accounted  for  in  the  Borrower’s  budget 
management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. 

Audit.  Upon the Bank’s request, the Borrower shall: 

have  the  account  designated  by  the  Borrower  pursuant  to  Section  E.1  of  this 
Section  audited  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  the  Bank,  in  accordance 
with consistently applied auditing standards acceptable to the Bank;

after the date of the Bank’s request for such audit, a certified copy of the report 
of  such  audit,  of  such  scope  and  in  such  detail  as  the  Bank  shall  reasonably 
request; and 

furnish to the Bank such other information concerning the account and its audit 
as the Bank shall reasonably request. 

Excluded Expenditures. The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall 
not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines at any time that an 
amount  of  the  Loan  was  used  to  make  a  payment  for  an  Excluded  Expenditure,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  an  amount  equal  to  the 
amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request

SCHEDULE 2 
 

Amortization Schedule 
 

1. 

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies.

Installment Share 
(Expressed as a Percentage) 

On each February 15 and August 15

through August 15, 2028 

On February 15, 2029 
 

9.09 % 

9.10 % 

2. 

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal 
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

 
(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment  Share”)  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion 
applies. 

 

 
 

 

 

-9- 

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and 
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of 
such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved 
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction 
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the 
provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
