health promotion and disease prevention programs, developing
human resources by strengthening modern public health training,
integrated pre-clinical medical training, and continuing
education for doctors, administrators and other health
personnel and support the on-going health financing reform to
ensure its sustainability, cost-effectiveness and equity
through establishing sound cost, performance analysis and

(ii) hospital management development, and (iii) medical

equipment support; (c) quality assurance and accreditation of
health professionals and facilities; and (d) primary health
care (PHC) and health protection service reorientation --

professionals in Tallinn, under the academic guidance of Tartu
Medical Faculty.

3.  Designing, constructing and equipping a new building for
Biomedical and Health Sciences at the University of Tartu.

Part C:  Efficient Management of Financial Resources

    Strengthening the capacity of the CHIA and the Local Health
Insurance Funds to collect, retrieve and analyze information
needed for providers and insurance administration through
improved accounting and management information procedures,
health insurance enrollment and collection, and reimbursement
methods; and establishing electronic links between these funds
and health care providers.

Part D:  Project Administration

to the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
