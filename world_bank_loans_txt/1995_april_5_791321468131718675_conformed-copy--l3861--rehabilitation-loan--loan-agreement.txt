                                Procurement

1.        Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to
cost the equivalent of $2,000,000 or more each shall be awarded
through international competitive bidding in accordance with
procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II
of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines),
subject to the following modifications:

    (a)   Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the
following is substituted therefor:

    "2.8 Notification and Advertising

          The international community should be notified in a
    timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This will be done
    by advertising invitations to apply for inclusion in a
    bidder’s invitation list, to apply for prequalification, or
    to bid; such advertisements should be placed in at least one
    newspaper of general circulation in the Borrower’s country
    and, in addition, in at least one of the following forms:

          (i)   a notice in the United Nations publication,
                Development Forum, Business Edition; or

          (ii)  an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or
                technical journal of wide international
                circulation; or

         (iii)  a notice to local representatives of
                countries and territories referred to in
                the Guidelines, that are potential
                suppliers of the goods required."

    (b)         The following is added at the end of paragraph
2.21 of the Guidelines:

          "As a further alternative, bidding documents may
    require the bidder to state the bid price in a single
    currency widely used in international trade and specified in
    the bidding documents."

    (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.

    (d)   For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid
referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide
that, when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid
validity period, the successful bidder’s bid price will be
increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed correction
factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all
foreign currency components and the other to the local currency
component of the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken
into account in the bid evaluation.

    (e)   In the procurement of goods in accordance with this
paragraph 1, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard
bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications
thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the
purposes of the Project.  Where no relevant standard bidding
documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use
bidding documents based on other internationally recognized
standard forms agreed with the Bank.

2.        Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to
cost the equivalent of less than $2,000,000 shall be awarded:

    (a)   by purchasers required to follow the Borrower’s public
procurement procedures for the importation of goods, on the
basis of such procedures, provided that such procedures shall
have been found acceptable by the Bank; and

    (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with established
commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be
awarded on the basis of comparison of quotations obtained from
suppliers from at least two countries, except that direct
contracting procedures acceptable to the Bank may be used where
considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines.

3.  Subject to the prior approval of the Bank, commonly traded
commodities (such as grain, sugar, cooking oil and industrial
raw materials) may be procured through organized international
commodity markets or other channels of competitive procurement
acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank.

4.        With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph
1 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank,
prior to the submission to the Bank of the first application
for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of
such contract, two conformed copies of such contract, together
with the analysis of the respective bids and recommendations
for award, a description of the advertising and tendering
procedures followed and such other information as the Bank
shall reasonably request.

5.        With respect to each contract referred to in paragraphs
2 and 3 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the
Bank, prior to the submission to the Bank of the first
application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in
respect thereof, such documentation and information as the Bank
may reasonably request to support withdrawal applications in
respect of such contract.
