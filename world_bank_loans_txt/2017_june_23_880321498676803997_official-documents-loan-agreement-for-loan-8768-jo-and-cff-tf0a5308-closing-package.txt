SCHEDULE  3

Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Non-
Concessional  Portion  of the Loan  and the percentage  of the total  principal  amount
of the Non-Concessional  Portion  of the  Loan  payable on  each Principal  Payment
Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Non-Concessional  Portion  of
the  Loan  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date, the
principal  amount  of the Non-Concessional  Portion  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by
multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Balance of the Non-Concessional  Portion of the Loan
as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each
Principal  Payment  Date,  such repayable  amount  to  be adjusted,  as necessary,  to
deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a
Currency Conversion applies.

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Non-Concessional  Portion  of the  Loan  have not  been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal  amount  of the Non-
Concessional  Portion  of the  Loan  repayable  by the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment Date shall be  determined as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Non-Concessional  Portion  of the
Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the
Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Balance  of the  Non-Concessional
Portion  of the  Loan as of such date in accordance  with paragraph  1 of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1 of  this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")

-14-

3. 

(a) 

and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary, to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule, to  which a  Currency
Conversion applies.

Amounts of the Non-Concessional  Portion  of the Loan withdrawn  within
two  calendar  months  prior  to  any Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the
purposes  solely  of  calculating  the  principal  amounts  payable  on  any
Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on the
second Principal  Payment Date following  the date of withdrawal  and shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the
second Principal  Payment  Date following  the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to  any withdrawals made after
the adoption  of such billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn  Balance of the  Non-
Concessional  Portion  of  the  Loan  to  an  Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so
converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is repayable  on any  Principal  Payment
Date occurring during  the Conversion Period,  shall  be determined by the Bank by
multiplying  such amount  in  its currency of denomination  immediately prior to the
Conversion by either:  (i) the  exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge
Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in
accordance  with the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate  component  of the
Screen Rate.

5. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Balance  of  the  Non-Concessional  Portion  of  the  Loan  is
denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall
apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to
produce a  separate  amortization  schedule for each such  amount.
