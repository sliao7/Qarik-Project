withdrawal  and  shall  be repayable  on each  Principal  Payment Date  commencing
with the second  Principal  Payment  Date following the date  of withdrawal.

(b)

Principal  Payment Date  occurring  during  the Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior

the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction

provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan Currency, so  as to produce  a separate amortization  schedule for each  such amount.
