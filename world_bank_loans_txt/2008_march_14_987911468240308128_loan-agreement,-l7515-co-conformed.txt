(a) 
Before  issuing  any  invitation  to  bid,  the  Borrower  shall  prepare  and  furnish  or 
cause to be prepared and furnished to the Bank for approval, appropriate model bidding 
documents.  Once approved by the Bank, the Borrower shall use, or cause to be used, said 
model  bidding  documents,  as  approved  for  bidding  under  the  Project.  Any  change  or 
departure from the model approved shall require Bank’s prior approval. 

All  bidders,  irrespective  of  whether  they  are  foreigners  or  Colombians,  will  be 
(b) 
treated equally and, particularly, no preference will be granted to any bidder or group of 
bidders  for  bid  evaluation  purposes.    Bidders  shall  be  allowed  to  submit  their  bids  by 
hand  or  through  the  post  office  or  private  mailing  services.    There  shall  not  be  any

Each  bid  shall  be  evaluated  and  the  corresponding  contract  awarded  to  the

criteria  stipulated  in  the  bidding  documents.  If  any  factor  additional  to  the  amount  or 
amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid evaluation, such factor or factors and the 
quantified manner in which they will be applied for purposes of determining the lowest 
evaluated bid shall be precisely stipulated in the bidding documents. For purposes of bid

be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, including correction of 
arithmetic errors.

their official duties, without the corresponding bidder’s written authorization. Moreover, 
bidders shall not be required to provide such authorization as a condition to be entitled to 
bid. This confidentiality requirement shall apply until the award of contract is notified to

portions  for  which  confidentiality  has  been  specifically  requested  by  the  bidder  in 
question.
