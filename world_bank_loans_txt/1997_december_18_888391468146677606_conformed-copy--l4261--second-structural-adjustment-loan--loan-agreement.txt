this Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the proceeds of the Loan from 
the Loan Account in support of the Program.

(b) 

The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank, the first

shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an

the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn amount of the Loan or 
any part thereof.

the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later 
date.
