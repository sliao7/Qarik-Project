multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by

2. 

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance
as of such  date  in accordance  with paragraph  I of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after the date  of such  withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the  Bank  by  multiplying the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which is the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after such

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall, for the  purposes  solely of calculating  the  principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following 
the  date  of
withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing
with the  second Principal  Payment Date  following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of
such  billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon  a Currency
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to  the  Conversion  by either:  (i) the  exchange  rate  that reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the
Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange rate  component  of the  Screen Rate.

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan  Currency,  so as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
