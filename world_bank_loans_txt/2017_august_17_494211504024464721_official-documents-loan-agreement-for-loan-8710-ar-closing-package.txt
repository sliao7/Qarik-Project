SCHEDULE  3

Amortization Schedule

1. 

The following  table  sets forth the  Principal  Payment Dates of the  Loan and the  percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the Loan have  been fully withdrawn  as  of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment
Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

2. 

If the proceeds  of the  Loan have  not been  fully withdrawn  as of the  first Principal Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date shall  be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as
of such  date in accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after the  date of such  withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the  Bank  by  multiplying the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the numerator  of which is the original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date, such  amounts repayable  to be adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the  Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as withdrawn  and  outstanding
on the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following the  date of withdrawal  and  shall

-15-

be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment Date  following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the Bank adopts a  due date billing system under which  invoices are  issued  on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption  of such
billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all or any  portion of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance to  an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,  shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by the  Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines, the  exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule  shall apply separately  to the amount  denominated  in each Loan
Currency,  so  as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
