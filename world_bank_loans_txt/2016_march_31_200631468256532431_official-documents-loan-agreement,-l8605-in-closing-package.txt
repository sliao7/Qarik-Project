(ii)

Principal  Payment  Date,  the principal  amount  of the Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on

to  deduct  any amounts  referred  to in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to which  a  Currency
Conversion applies.

Payment  Date shall be determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the extent  that  any proceeds  of the  Loan have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as
of such date in accordance  with paragraph  I  of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be  repaid  on
each Principal  Payment  Date falling  after the date  of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the  Bank by  multiplying the amount  of each  such withdrawal  by a
fraction,  the numerator of which  is the original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in paragraph  I of this Schedule  for said Principal  Payment Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on or  after  such
date, such amounts  repayable  to be adjusted, as  necessary,  to deduct any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months  prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable on any Principal  Payment Date, be treated  as  withdrawn and outstanding
on the  second  Principal  Payment Date following the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date following the date of withdrawal.

-9-

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if  at  any
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under  which invoices  are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer apply to  any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the Bank under the  Currency  Hedge Transaction  relating
to the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the  exchange rate  component  of the Screen Rate.

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule  shall apply  separately to the amount denominated  in each Loan
Currency, so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each such amount.
