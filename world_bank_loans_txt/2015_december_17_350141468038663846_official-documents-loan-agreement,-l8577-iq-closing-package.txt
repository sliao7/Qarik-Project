of  the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn  as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the Loan  repayable  by the  Borrower  on

(a)  Withdrawn Loan Balance  as  of the first Principal  Payment Date;  by (b)  the Installment

to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal  Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date shall be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the  extent that  any proceeds  of the Loan  have been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal Payment  Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance as
of such date in accordance  with paragraph  1  of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be  repaid  on
each Principal  Payment  Date falling after the date  of such withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by the Bank by  multiplying the amount  of each such withdrawal  by a
fraction, the numerator  of which  is the original Installment  Share  specified  in the
table in  paragraph  1  of this  Schedule for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date, such  amounts repayable  to be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the principal  amounts
payable  on any Principal  Payment Date,  be  treated as withdrawn  and outstanding
on the  second Principal  Payment  Date  following the date of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the Bank adopts  a due date billing system under which invoices  are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1  and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,  shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (a)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency payable  by the Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (b)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate component  of the Screen Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule shall  apply separately to the amount  denominated in each Loan
Currency,  so as to produce a separate  amortization  schedule  for each such amount.
