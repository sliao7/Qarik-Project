shall  be determined  by the Bank  by multiplying  such  amount  in its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the Conversion by either.  (i) the exchange rate
that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in the  Approved  Currency payable  by  the
Bank under the  Currency Hedge Transaction  relating to the  Conversion;  or (ii) if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component of the Screen Rate.
