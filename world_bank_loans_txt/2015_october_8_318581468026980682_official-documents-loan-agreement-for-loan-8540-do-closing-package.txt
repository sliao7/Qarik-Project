percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have  been fully
withdrawn as  of the first Principal  Payment Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each  Principal  Payment Date  shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by  (b) the Installment  Share for each  Principal  Payment Date,  such
repayable  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to
in paragraph 4  of this  Schedule,  to which  a Currency  Conversion applies.

If the proceeds  of the  Loan have  not been fully  withdrawn  as of the first  Principal

each  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent  that any proceeds  of the Loan  have been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by  multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

-15-

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan withdrawn  within two  calendar months prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date  of withdrawal  and  shall be repayable  on  each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall  no longer apply to  any withdrawals made after
the  adoption  of such  billing  system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on  any Principal Payment  Date  occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion  by either:  (i)  the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in more  than one  Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated
in each  Loan Currency,  so as  to produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
