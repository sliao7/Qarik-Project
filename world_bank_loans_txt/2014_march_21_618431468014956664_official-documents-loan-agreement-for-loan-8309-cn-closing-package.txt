The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the.
percentage  of the total principal  amount  of the Loan  payable  on  each  Principal Payment
Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds of the  Loan have  been  fully withdrawn  as of
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by
multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as  of the first Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be
adjusted,  as necessary, to  deduct any amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4 of this Schedule,
to which a Currency Conversion  applies.

Principal Payment Date shall  be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent  that any proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been withdrawn  as of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the Borrower  shall repay  the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance
as of such  date  in accordance  with  paragraph  1 of this  Schedule.

Any  amount withdrawn  after the  first Principal  Payment  Date shall  be repaid  on
each Principal  Payment Date falling  after the date of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the Bank by multiplying  the amount of each  such withdrawal  by a
fraction,  the numerator of which  is the  original  Installment Share  specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for  said Principal Payment  Date ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment Dates  falling on  or  after  such
date,  such amounts repayable  to be  adjusted, as necessary,  to deduct any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment Date  shall,  for the purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of
withdrawal  and  shall  be repayable  on each  Principal  Payment  Date commencing
with the  second Principal  Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer apply  to any  withdrawals  made  after the  adoption  of
such billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that  is repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the Bank  by multiplying  such  amount  in  its currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to the Conversion by  either:  (i)  the  exchange rate that reflects  the amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the.
Conversion  Guidelines, the exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a separate amortization  schedule for each  such  amount.
