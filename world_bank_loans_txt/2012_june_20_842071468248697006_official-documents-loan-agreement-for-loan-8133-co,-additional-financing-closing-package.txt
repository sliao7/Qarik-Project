(iii) 

Before  issuing any  invitation  to bid, the  Borrower, through  MADS,  shall
prepare  and  furnish,  or  cause  to  be  prepared  and  furnished  to  the  Bank,

All  bidders,  irrespective  of whether  they  are  foreigners  or  Colombians,
will  be treated  equally and,  particularly,  no preference  will be  granted  to
any  bidder  or group  of bidders for bid evaluation  purposes.  Bidders  shall
be  allowed  to  submit  their  bids  by  hand  or  through  the  post  office  or
private  mailing  services.  There  shall  not  be  any  requirement  for  any
bidder  to  show  evidence  of  the  bidder's  registration

the  responsive  bidder  who  meets  appropriate  technical  and  financial

-14-

standards  of  capability  and  whose  bid  has  been  determined  to  be  the
lowest  evaluated  bid.  Such  determination  shall  be  made  exclusively  on
the  basis  of  the  specifications,  conditions  and  evaluation  criteria
stipulated  in  the  bidding  documents.  If  any  factor  additional  to  the
amount  or amounts  of each  bid is  to be  considered  in bid evaluation, such
factor  or factors  and  the  quantified manner on which  they will be applied
for  purposes  of determining  the  lowest  evaluated  bid  shall  be  precisely
stipulated  in  the  bidding  documents.  For  purposes  of bid  evaluation  and

including correction  of arithmetic  errors.

The  provisions  of paragraph  2.47 of the  Guidelines  shall  fully  apply and,

corresponding  bidder's  written authorization.  Moreover,  bidders  shall not
be  required  to  provide  such  authorization  as  a  condition  to  be  entitled  to
bid.  This  confidentiality  requirement  shall  apply  until  the  award  of
contract  is notified to  the  successful  bidder. Thereafter, confidentiality  of
the  bids  shall  be  limited  to  those  bid  portions  for  which  confidentiality
has  been  specifically  requested  by the  bidder in question.
