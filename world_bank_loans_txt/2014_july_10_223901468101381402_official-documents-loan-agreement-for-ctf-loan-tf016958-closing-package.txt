Project Description

The  objective  of the  Project  is  to  assist  the  Republic  of  Turkey  in  meeting  its
increased  power  demand  by strengthening  the transmission  system  and  facilitating  large-
scale renewable  energy  generation.

The  Project consists  of the following  parts:

Part 

. Development  of transmission  infrastructure

Construction  and  equipping  of highly  digitalized  substations,  namely  Can  Basin
380  kV,  Izmir  Basin  380  kV,  and  Vize  Basin  380  kV  substations  and  any  other
substations  agreed  with  the  World  Bank,  together  with  associated  grid  connection
structures  for evacuation  of wind  power in  the  Selected  Provinces.
Part  2.  Smart-grid  investments

Carry  out  investments  that  enable  the Borrower  to  monitor the  transmission  grid
network  status  in  real-time  and  to  operate  the  entire  network  reliably  and  securely,
including:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d)

addition  of  a  Renewable  Energy  Resource  ("RER")  Operator  Desk  on  the
SCADA  system.

Installation  of Remote  Terminal  Units  ("RTU")  in  substations  and  power  plants
to facilitate  acquisition  of real-time  transmission  network  data.

Installation  of  digital  protection  relays  in  the  power  grid  to  accelerate  fault
clearing  and  minimize  network  disturbances  and outage  area.
Installation  of shunt  reactors  in  the  bulk-transmission  network  to  control  load
flow and  to secure  appropriate  system  voltage.
