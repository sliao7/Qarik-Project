3.
opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special 
Account shall be made as follows:

(a)

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a 
request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed 
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank 
shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account 
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.   

(b)

(i)

For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the 
Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank 
shall specify.

(ii)

Prior  to  or  at  the  time  of  each  such  request,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the 
Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule  for  the  payment  or  payments  in  respect  of  which  replenishment  is 
requested.  On  the  basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the 
Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the  Special 
Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have  requested  and  as  shall  have 
been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the 
Special Account for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn 

by the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, and 
in  the  respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall  have  been  justified  by  said 
documents and other evidence.

For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower shall, at such 
4.
time  as  the  Bank  shall  reasonably  request,  furnish  to  the  Bank  such  documents  and  other  evidence 
showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.   

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to 

5.
make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a)

if,  at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  that  all  further  withdrawals  should  be 
made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of 
the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

(b)

if  the  Borrower  shall  have  failed  to  furnish  to  the  Bank,  within  the  period  of  time 
specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to 
the  Bank  pursuant  to  said  Section  in  respect  of  the  audit  of  the  records  and  accounts  for  the  Special 
Account;

(c)

if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention to suspend in 
whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

(d)

once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories, 
minus  the  total  amount  of  all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to 
Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation.  Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the 
Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to 
the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that  all  such  amounts  remaining  on  deposit  in  the 
Special  Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  eligible 
expenditures.

(a)

6.
If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the  Special 
Account: (i)  was made for an  expenditure or in an  amount not eligible pursuant  to paragraph 2 of  this 
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly 
upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit 
into  the Special  Account  (or, if  the Bank  shall  so request,  refund  to the  Bank) an  amount  equal to  the 
amount  of  such  payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall 
otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the  Bank  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  until  the 
Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b)

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the Special 
Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures,  the  Borrower  shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

(c)

The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any portion of the 

funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d)

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall 
be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for  cancellation  in  accordance  with  the 
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
