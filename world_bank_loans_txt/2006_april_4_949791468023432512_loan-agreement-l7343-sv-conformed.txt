requested.

Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  Eligible

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

 
The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
1. 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment 
Date (Installment Share). If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying: 
(a)  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  as  of  the  first 
Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date[, 
such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2. 
If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  not  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first 
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  amount  withdrawn  and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 
 

(b) 

Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  shall  be  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the 
table  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original 
Installment  Share)  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date[, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(a) 

 
3. 
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable on 
any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second 
Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the 
date of withdrawal. 

 

-25-

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, if 
at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph 
shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 
 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
4. 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall be 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  said  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the 
amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in 
accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange  rate  component  of  the  Screen 
Rate. 
 
5. 
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall 
apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a 
separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
