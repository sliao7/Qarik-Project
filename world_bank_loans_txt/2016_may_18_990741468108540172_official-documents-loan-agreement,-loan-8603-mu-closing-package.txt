Guidelines.

-3-

percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have  been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal  Payment Date, the principal amount  of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal  Payment Date shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by (b) the Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount to be adjusted,  as  necessary, to  deduct any amounts  referred  to
in paragraph 4 of this  Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

Principal Payment  Date 

On  each May  15  and November  15

Beginning May  15,  2021

each Principal  Payment  Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have  been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of such
withdrawal  in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1 of this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to be adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts referred  to  in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which a Currency
Conversion applies.

-9-

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within two  calendar months prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date, be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption  of such billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1 through 3 of this Schedule,  in the
event of a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of a Disbursed Amount to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date occurring during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to  the Conversion  by either:  (i) the exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under  the Currency Hedge  Transaction  relating to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in more  than one  Loan Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount  denominated
in each Loan Currency.
