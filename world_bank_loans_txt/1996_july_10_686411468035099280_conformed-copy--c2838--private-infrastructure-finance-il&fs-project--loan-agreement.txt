      (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in

3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the
Special Account and the Swap Account have been duly opened, withdrawal
of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish
the Special Account shall be made as follows:

      (a)   (i)   For withdrawal of the Authorized Allocation, the
                  Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request for
                  deposit into the Special Account the amount of the
                  Authorized Allocation. Prior to such request, the
                  Borrower shall confirm to the Bank that it has
                  negotiated a Swap Agreement with a proposed Swap
                  Counterparty for exchanging such amount into Rupees.
                  On the basis of such request, the Bank shall, on
                  behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
                  Account and deposit into the Special Account such
                  amount as the Borrower shall have requested.

                  this Schedule, the Borrower shall withdraw such
                  amount in its entirety for implementing the Swap
                  Agreement and deposit the equivalent Rupee amount
                  obtained under such Swap Agreement into the Swap
                  Account.

            (iii) If within the period referred to in paragraph 3 (a)
                  (ii) of this Schedule the amount deposited in the
                  Special Account shall not have been withdrawn and
                  deposited into the Swap Account in accordance with
                  such paragraph, the Borrower shall, promptly
                  upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank all

                  such amounts on deposit in the Special Account.

      (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower
                  shall furnish to the Bank, upon the utilization of at
                  least 80% of the amount in the Swap Account for
                  eligible expenditures, requests for deposits into the
                  Special Account. Prior to each such request, the
                  Borrower shall confirm to the Bank that it has
                  negotiated a Swap Agreement with a proposed Swap
                  Counterparty for exchanging the requested amount into
                  Rupees.

           (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                  Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and
                  other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of
                  this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect
                  of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of
                  each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                  Borrower,  withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
                  into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                  shall have requested and as shall have been shown by
                  said documents and other evidence to have been paid
                  out of the Swap Account for eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be:  (A) withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the eligible Category, and in the equivalent amounts, as
shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence; and (B)
subject to the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 3 (a)
of this Schedule.

4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Swap Account,
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request,
furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that
such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the
Special Account:

      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

      (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,
within the period of time specified in Section 4.02 (a) (ii) of this
Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the
Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records
and accounts for the Special Account or the Swap Account; or

      (c)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Category shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Swap Account as of the date of
such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Swap Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or
in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule;
or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the
Swap Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof

not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or
refund, as the case may be.

      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Swap Account will not be required to cover
further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstand-
ing amount.

      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account
or the Swap Account.

      (d)   (i)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 3
                  (a) (iii), and 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule
                  shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent
                  withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with
                  the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including
                  the General Conditions.

            (ii)  Such refunds of the Rupee amounts in the Swap Account
                  shall be made initially to the Special Account in
                  Dollars calculated in accordance with paragraph 6
                  (d) (iv) of this Schedule. The amounts refunded to
                  the Special Account shall be immediately refunded
                  to the Bank.

            (iii) Such refunds shall be made notwithstanding the Swap
                  Agreements entered into by the Borrower in respect
                  of such amounts.

            (iv)  The exchange rate used for converting such refunds
                  from the Rupee amounts in the Swap Account to Dollars
                  shall be the rate at which the respective Rupee
                  amounts were converted from the Dollar amounts in
                  the Special Account pursuant to the relevant Swap
                  Agreements. If any question arises on the applicable
                  exchange rate to be used in respect of any amount to
                  be refunded, the rate shall be as determined by the
                  Bank.
