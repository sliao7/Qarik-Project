               another currency, such valuation shall be made on the
               basis of the prevailing lawful rate of exchange at which
               such other currency is, at the time of such valuation,
               obtainable for the purposes of servicing such debt, or,

two years by September 30, to meet the requirements of said Section.

     Section 4.04. (a) Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the
Borrower shall ensure that no Participating Local Government shall
incur any debt unless a reasonable forecast of the revenues and expen-
ditures of such Participating Local Government shows that the projected
non-grant and local revenues for a Fiscal Year minus the projected
routine account expenditure on staff administration and routine
operational and maintenance needs of such Participating Local Govern-
ment for each Fiscal Year during the term of the debt to be incurred
shall be at least 1.5 times the projected debt service requirement of
such Participating Local Government in such year on all debt of such
Participating Local Government including the debt to be incurred.

     (b)  For the purposes of this Section:

          (i)  the term "debt" means any indebtedness of a Participating

               (A)  under a loan contract or agreement or other
                    instrument providing for such debt or further
                    modification of its terms of payment, on the

        (iii)  The term "debt service requirement" means the aggregate
               amount of repayments (including sinking fund payments,
               if any) of, and interest and other charges on, debt.

         (iv)  The term "reasonable forecast" means a forecast prepared
               by a Participating Local Government in the Fiscal Year
               in which the debt in question is to be incurred, which
               both the Bank and the Participating Local Government
               accept as reasonable and as to which the Bank has
               notified the Participating Local Government of its
               acceptability, provided that no event has occurred since
               such notification which has, or may reasonably be
               expected in the future to have, a material adverse effect
               on the financial condition or operating results of such
               Participating Local Government.

          (v)  Whenever for the purposes of this Section it shall be
               necessary to value, in terms of Rupiah, debt payable in
               another currency, such valuation shall be made on the
               basis of the prevailing lawful rate of exchange at which
               such other currency is, at the time of such valuation,
               obtainable for the purpose of servicing such debt, or,
               with the absence of such rate on the basis of a rate of

               exchange acceptable to the Bank.

2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for

shall be made as follows:

     (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the
Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such
request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, with-
draw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

     (b)  (i)  For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower

               the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall
               specify.

               Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and
               other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of
               this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect
               of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of
               each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
               Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
               into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
               shall have requested and as shall have been shown by
               said documents and other evidence to have been paid

               out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.

furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that
such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the
Special Account:

     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agree-
ment;

     (b)  if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,

Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the
Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records

of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

     (d)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall
equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account:

          (i)  was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
               eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule;
               or

         (ii)  was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
               Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from
               the Bank:

               (A)  provide such additional evidence as the Bank
                    may request; or

               (B)  deposit into the Special Account (or, if the
                    Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an
                    amount equal to the amount of such payment or
                    the portion thereof not so eligible or
                    justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
                    agree, no further deposit by the Bank into
                    the Special Account shall be made until the
                    Borrower has provided such evidence or made
                    such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover
further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.

     (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
