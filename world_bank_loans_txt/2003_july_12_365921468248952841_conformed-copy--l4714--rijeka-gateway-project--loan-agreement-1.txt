For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the

Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such 
notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures. 
 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the Special 
6. 
Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of 
this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall,

Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or 
refund, as the case may be.
