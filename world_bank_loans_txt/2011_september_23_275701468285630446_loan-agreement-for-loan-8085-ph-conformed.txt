LOAN AGREEMENT 

 

AGREEMENT dated September 23, 2011, entered into between the REPUBLIC 
 
OF  THE  PHILIPPINES  (“the  Borrower”)  and  the  INTERNATIONAL  BANK  FOR 
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (“the Bank”) for the purpose of providing 
financing in support of the Program (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).  The 
Bank  has  decided  to  provide  this  financing  on  the  basis,  inter  alia,  of:  (a)  the  actions 
which  the  Borrower  has  already  taken  under  the  Program  and  which  are  described  in 
Section  I  of  Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement;  and  (b)  the  Borrower’s  maintenance  of  an 
adequate  macroeconomic  policy  framework.    The  Borrower  and  the  Bank  therefore 
hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 

1.01.  The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement) 

constitute an integral part of this Agreement. 

1.02.  Unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  the  capitalized  terms  used  in  this 
Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in 
the Appendix to this Agreement. 

ARTICLE II — LOAN 

2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or 
referred  to  in  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of  five  hundred  million  dollars 
($500,000,000), as such amount  may be converted from time to time through a 
Currency  Conversion  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section  2.07  of  this 
Agreement (“Loan”). 

2.02.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program 

in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement.  

2.03.  The  Front-end  Fee  payable  by  the  Borrower  shall  be  equal  to  one  half  of  one 

percent (0.50%) of the Loan amount. 

2.04. 

If, at the Borrower’s request and on such terms and conditions as the Bank may 
agree,  the  Closing  Date  is  extended,  the  fee  payable  by  the  Borrower  for  each 
extension of the Closing Date shall be at the rate of one quarter of one percent 

2 

 

 

 

(0.25%)  of  the  amount  of  the  Loan  available  for  withdrawal  upon  such 
extension.  If the Borrower elects to capitalize the fee from the Loan, the Bank 
shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to 
itself such amounts required to pay such fee.  If the Borrower elects to pay the 
fee from its own resources, the Borrower shall pay such fee not later than sixty 
(60)  days  after  the  date  of  the  notice  given  by  the  Bank  to  the  Borrower 
confirming the extension of the Closing Date. 

2.05.  The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate 
equal  to  the  Reference  Rate  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Variable  Spread; 
provided, that upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of 
the Loan, the interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on 
such  amount  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of 
Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any 
amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-
payment continues for a period of thirty (30) days, then the interest payable by 
the  Borrower  shall  instead  be  calculated  as  provided  in  Section  3.02(e)  of  the 
General Conditions. 

2.06.  The Payment Dates are April 15 and October 15 in each year. 

2.07. 

(a) 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  paragraph  (b)  of  this  Section,  the 
principal  amount  of  the  Loan  shall  be  repaid  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of Schedule 2 to this Agreement. 

(b) 

The  Borrower  may  at  the time  of  requesting  a  Withdrawal also  request 
repayment  provisions  different  from  those  set  out  in Schedule  2  to  this 
Agreement for such Withdrawal, provided that: (i) the average maturity 
of  such  Withdrawal  does  not  exceed  eighteen  (18)  years  from  the 
Withdrawal  Date  and  the  final  maturity  of  such  Withdrawal  does  not 
exceed thirty (30) years from the Withdrawal Date (or such other average 
maturity  and/or  final  maturity  as  may  be  generally  applicable  to  loans 
made by the Bank to the Borrower at the time of such agreement); and 
(ii) such repayment provisions have been agreed between the Borrower 
and the Bank prior to the Withdrawal Date of such Withdrawal. 

2.08. 

(a) 

The Borrower may at any time request any of the following Conversions 
of the terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: 
(i) a change of the Loan Currency of all or any portion of the principal 
amount  of  the  Loan,  withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved 
Currency; (ii) a change of the interest rate basis applicable to all or any 
portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding 
from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice versa, or from a Variable 

3 

Rate  based  on  a  Variable  Spread  to  a  Variable  Rate  based  on  a  Fixed 
Spread; and (iii) the setting of limits on the Variable Rate applicable to 
all  or  any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and 
outstanding by the establishment of an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate 
Collar on the Variable Rate. 

(b) 

 
(c) 

Any conversion requested pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section that 
is accepted by the Bank shall be considered a “Conversion”, as defined 
in the General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the 
provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion 
Guidelines.  

Promptly  following  the  Execution  Date  for  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or 
Interest  Rate  Collar  for  which  the  Borrower  has  requested  that  the 
premium  be  paid  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan,  the  Bank  shall,  on 
behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to 
itself  the  amounts  required  to  pay  any  premium  payable  in  accordance 
with  Section  4.05(c)  of  the  General  Conditions  up  to  the  amount 
allocated from time to time for the purpose in the table in Section II of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement. 

 

 

 

2.09.  At any time prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower may, by notice to the Bank, 
refund any amount of the Withdrawn Balance for the purpose of re-crediting such 
amount  to  the  Loan  Account  for  further  withdrawals.    Upon  such  refund,  the 
repayment schedule shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis, on terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Bank. 

2.10.  Without limitation upon the provisions of Section 5.08 of the General Conditions 
(renumbered as such pursuant to paragraph 3 of Section II of the Appendix to this 
Agreement  and  relating  to  Cooperation  and  Consultation),  the  Borrower  shall 
promptly furnish to the Bank such information relating to the provisions of this 
Article II as the Bank may, from time to time, reasonably request. 

ARTICLE III — PROGRAM  

3.01.  The  Borrower  declares  its  commitment  to  the  Program  and  its  implementation.  

To this end, and further to Section 5.08 of the General Conditions: 

4 

 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  shall  from  time  to  time,  at  the  request  of 
either  party,  exchange  views  on  the  Borrower’s  progress  achieved  in 
carrying out the Program; 

prior to each such exchange of views, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank  for  its  review  and  comment  a  report  on  the  progress  achieved  in 
carrying  out  the  Program,  in  such  detail  as  the  Bank  shall  reasonably 
request; and 

without limitation  upon the  provisions  of  paragraphs  (a)  and (b)  of  this 
Section,  the  Borrower  shall  promptly  inform  the  Bank  of  any  situation 
that  would  have  the  effect  of  materially  reversing  the  objectives  of  the 
Program  or  any  action  taken  under  the  Program  including  any  action 
specified in Section I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

 Program Actions; Availability of Loan Proceeds 

Section I. 

Actions taken under the Program 

The actions taken by the Borrower under the Program to enhance its capacity to 
implement  a  disaster  risk  management  program  for  adverse  natural  events  include  the 
following: 

The  Borrower  has  enacted  the  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and  Management  Act 
(Republic Act No. 10121) of May 2010 which seeks to mainstream disaster risk 
reduction into development policies and processes; and which has expanded the 
focus  of  disaster  management  from  ex-post  actions  and  funding  for  emergency 
response,  relief  and  recovery  to  include  ex-ante  actions  and  funding  for  risk 
reduction, preparedness and prevention. 

The Borrower has adopted the Strategic National Action Plan for Disaster Risk 
Reduction  (Executive  Order  No.  888)  of  June  2010,  a  ten-year  plan  to  achieve 
the commitments made under the Hyogo Framework of Action. 

Section II. 

Availability of Loan Proceeds 

General.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance 
with the provisions of this Section and such additional instructions as the Bank 
may specify by notice to the Borrower. 

Allocation of Loan Amounts.  The Loan (except for amounts required to pay the 
Front-end  Fee)  is  allocated  in  a  single  withdrawal  tranche,  from  which  the 
Borrower may make withdrawals of the Loan proceeds.  The Borrower shall be 
entitled to withdraw the Single Tranche from the Loan Account in support of the 
Program  in  various  Withdrawals. The  allocation  of  the  amounts  of  the  Loan  to 
this end is set out in the table below: 

 

Allocations 

(1) Single Withdrawal Tranche 
(2) Front-end Fee 
(3) Fee payable pursuant to 
Section  2.04 of this Agreement

C. 

Payment of Fee Pursuant to Section 2.04 of Agreement.  If the Closing Date is 
extended pursuant to Section 2.04 of this Agreement and the Borrower elects to 
finance  from  its  own  resources  the  fee  set  forth  in  said  Section,  no  withdrawal 
shall be made from the Loan Account until the Bank has received payment in full 
of such fee. 

D. 

Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds 

1. 
No withdrawal shall be made of the Single Withdrawal Tranche unless a 
State of Calamity exists in the Borrower’s territory as a result of a natural disaster 
which has been declared by the Borrower’s President through a Proclamation of 
Calamity  duly  published  in  the  Official  Gazette  in  accordance  with  the 
Borrower’s legislation. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the receipt by the 
2. 
Bank of a request for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, the Bank determines 
that  a  situation  has  arisen  that  has  or  would  have  the  effect  of  materially 
reversing the objectives of the Program or any action taken under the Program, 
the Bank shall give notice to the Borrower to that effect.  Upon the giving of such 
notice, no withdrawals shall be made of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance unless 
and until the Bank has notified the Borrower of its satisfaction, after an exchange 
of  views  as  described  in  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of  said  Section  3.01,  with  the 
measures taken by the Borrower to rectify such situation. 

E. 

Deposits of Loan Amounts 

                                                 
1 The amount allocated to this category will be zero until the borrower decides to renew the DPL. 

9 

 

1. 
The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank the request for 
withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account,  and  shall  thereafter  maintain  a  deposit 
account  in  Dollars  in  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  on  terms  and  conditions 
satisfactory to the Bank (“Deposit Account”). 

All withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank 

2. 
into the Deposit Account. 

3. 
Upon  the  deposit  of  the  amount  of  the  Loan  into  the  Deposit  Account, 
the  Borrower  shall  ensure  that  an  equivalent  amount  is  accounted  for  in  the 
Borrower’s budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. 

F. 

Audit 

Upon the Bank’s request, the Borrower shall: 

have the Deposit Account audited by independent auditors acceptable to 
1. 
the Bank, in accordance with consistently applied auditing standards acceptable 
to the Bank; 

furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later than six 
2. 
(6) months after the date of the Bank’s request for such audit, a certified copy of 
the  report  of  such  audit,  of  such  scope  and  in  such  detail  as  the  Bank  shall 
reasonably  request  and  make  such  report  publicly  available  in  a  timely  fashion 
and in a manner acceptable to the Bank; and  

furnish  to  the  Bank  such  other  information  concerning  the  Deposit 

3. 
Account and its audit as the Bank shall reasonably request. 

G. 

Excluded  Expenditures.    The  Borrower  undertakes  that  the  proceeds  of  the 
Loan shall not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines 
at  any  time  that  an  amount  of  the  Loan  was  used  to  make  a  payment  for  an 
Excluded Expenditure, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, 
refund  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  such  payment  to  the  Bank.  Amounts 
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

repay each Disbursed Amount in semiannual installments payable on each April 
15  and  October  15,  the  first  installment  to  be  payable  on  the  20th  Interest 
Payment Date following the Maturity Fixing Date for the Disbursed Amount and 
the last installment to be payable on the 50th Interest Payment Date following the 
Maturity Fixing Date for the Disbursed Amount. Each installment except for the 
last  one  shall  be  equal  to one-thirty  one  (1/31)  of  the  Disbursed  Amount.    The

The  Bank  shall  notify  the  Loan  Parties  of  the  amortization  schedule  for  each 
Disbursed  Amount  promptly  after  the  Maturity  Fixing  Date  for  the  Disbursed 
Amount. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 through 2 of this Schedule, in the 
event of a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of a Disbursed Amount to 
an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that 
is  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in each Loan Currency.
