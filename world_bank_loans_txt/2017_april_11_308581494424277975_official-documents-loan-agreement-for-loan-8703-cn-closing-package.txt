documents.

To  the extent  that  any proceeds  of the  Loan have  been withdrawn  as  of the first
Principal  Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance  as
of such date in accordance  with paragraph  1 of this Schedule.

Any amount  withdrawn  after the  first Principal Payment  Date  shall  be repaid  on
each Principal Payment  Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is the original Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal Payment Dates  falling  on or after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable to be  adjusted, as necessary,  to deduct any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar  months prior to any Principal
Payment Date  shall,  for the purposes  solely of calculating  the principal amounts
payable  on any  Principal Payment Date, be treated as  withdrawn  and outstanding
on the second Principal  Payment Date following the date of withdrawal  and shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this paragraph,  if at  any
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1 and 2 of this  Schedule,  upon a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion  Period, shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in the
Approved  Currency payable  by the  Bank under  the Currency Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if the  Bank so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate component of the Screen Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan
Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization  schedule for each such amount.
