percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal  Payment Date, the principal amount  of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower  on each Principal  Payment Date shall  be  determined by

the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date

referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.]

If the proceeds  of the Loan have  not been  fully withdrawn  as  of the first Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds  of the Loan have  been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date  [, such amounts  repayable to  be adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any
amounts  referred to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.]

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within two  calendar  months  prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal  and  shall be repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank  adopts a due date  billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made  after
the adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on any Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion by  either:  (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the amount  denominated
in each Loan  Currency,  so as  to produce a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
