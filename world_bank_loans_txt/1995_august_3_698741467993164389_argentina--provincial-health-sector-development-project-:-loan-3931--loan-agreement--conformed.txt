(a)  For withdrawals  of the  Authorized  Allocation,  the Borrower  shall  furnish  to the

been  shown by  said  documents  and  other  evidence  to have  been  paid  out  of
the  Special  Account  for  eligible  expenditures.

All  such  deposits  shall  be  withdrawn  by  the  Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under  the
respective eligible Categories,  and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been
justified  by  said  documents  and  other evidence.

4.  For  each  payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out  of the  Special  Account,  the Borrower

eligible  expenditures.

5.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of paragraph  3 of this Schedule,  the Bank shall  not be
required  to  make  further  deposits into  the  Special Account:

(a) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further  withdrawals  should
be  made  by  the  Borrower  directly  from  the  Loan  Account  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of Article  V of the  General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a)  of Section  2.02  of
this  Agreement;  or

(d)  once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible
Categories,  less the  amount  of any  outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by  the
Bank pursuant to Section  5.02  of the General  Conditions with  respect to the Project,  shall
equal  the  equivalent  of twice the amount  of the  Authorized  Allocation.

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the Loan Account of the remaining  unwithdrawn  amount
of the Loan  allocated  to the  eligible Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as the Bank
shall  specify  by  notice  to  the  Borrower.  Such  further  withdrawals  shall  be  made  only
after  and  to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that  all  such  amounts

- 30  -

remaining  on deposit  in  the Special  Account  as of the date  of such  notice will  be  utilized
in  making payments  for  eligible  expenditures.

If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the
6.  (a) 
Special  Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not eligible  pursuant
to  paragraph  2  of this Schedule;  or (ii)  was not justified  by the  evidence  furnished  to  the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional  evidence as  the Bank may request;  or (B)  deposit  into the  Special  Account  (or,
if the Bank  shall  so request,  refund  to  the Bank)  an  amount  equal to the  amount  of such
payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the Bank  into  the Special  Account  shall  be  made
until the Borrower has  provided such evidence  or made such deposit or refund,  as the case
may  be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any  amount  outstanding  in the
Special  Account will  not  be required  to  cover further  payments for eligible  expenditures,
the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  such
outstanding  amount.

(c)  The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or  any

portion  of the  funds  on  deposit  in the  Special  Account.

Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of this Agreement,  including  the
General  Conditions.
