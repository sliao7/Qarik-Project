in  accordance  with  the  schedule  set  out  in  the  DAK  Implementing 
Regulations,  and  shall  notify  the  Bank  of  this  amount  by  no  later  than 
March  31  in  such  Fiscal  Year,  commencing  with  March  31,  2011 
(Annual  DAK  Allocation).    MOF  shall  make  payments  of  DAK  funds 
(DAK  Transfers)  from  the  Borrower’s  budget  to  each  Pilot  Local 
Government  in  accordance  with  the  DAK  Regulations  in  each  Fiscal 
Year of Project implementation.   

Advance  Payments  against  Outputs.    The  Borrower  may  request 
withdrawal of the proceeds of the Loan as an Advance Payment against 
Outputs  in  each  Fiscal  Year  of  Project  Implementation,  beginning  with 
Outputs produced in Fiscal Year 2011.  Each Advance Payment shall be 
subject to the procedures and conditions set out below, except as may be 
otherwise agreed in writing between the Borrower and the Bank. 
 
(i) 

The amount of the Advance Payment in any Fiscal Year shall not 
exceed  the  sum  of  the  Rupiah  values  of  the  first  of  the  DAK 
Transfers  made  by  MOF  to  each  Pilot  Local  Government  by 
March  31  in  such  Fiscal  Year  as  such  transfers  are  verified  by 
BPKP,  provided  however  that  in  no  event  shall  the  Advance 
Payment  exceed  thirty  percent  (30%)  of  the  Annual  DAK 
Allocation for that Fiscal Year.   

14 

(ii) 

The  Advance  Payment  in  any  given  Fiscal  Year  may  be  made 
prior to the verification of Outputs; provided, however that it is 
subject  to  set-off,  as  set  out  in  sub-paragraph  (g)  of  this 
paragraph, following the receipt by the Bank of the Verification 
Report for Outputs for that Fiscal Year to ensure that proceeds of 
the  Loan  are  not  disbursed  in  excess  of  the  Value  of  Total 
Reimbursement  for  all  Pilot  Local  Governments  for  that  Fiscal 
Year.  

(f) 

Reimbursement  of  Verified  Outputs.    The  Borrower  may  request 
withdrawal  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  as  a  Reimbursement  against 
Outputs  in  each  Fiscal  Year  of  Project  implementation,  beginning  with 
Outputs  produced  in  Fiscal  Year  2011.    Each  Reimbursement  shall  be 
subject to the procedures and conditions set out below, except as may be 
otherwise agreed in writing between the Borrower and the Bank. 
 
(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

(iv) 

(v) 

(vi) 

BPKP shall verify that each Pilot Local Government has entered 
into a Commitment Letter. 
 
BPKP shall verify that the Reference Unit Costs were provided 
by February 15 in the subject Fiscal Year. 
 
BPKP  shall  list  all  Outputs  reported  by  each  Pilot  Local 
Government by December 31 of the subject Fiscal Year. 
 
BPKP  shall  calculate  the  Value  of  Potential  Reimbursement 
for  each  Pilot  Local  Government  by  multiplying  the  volume  of 
Outputs  produced  by  Sub-projects  undertaken  by  Pilot  Local 
Government by their Reference Unit Costs. 
 
BPKP  shall  verify  a  Sample  of  the  Sub-projects  in  each  Pilot 
Local  Government  in  accordance  with  the  VO  Terms  of 
Reference to determine compliance with the Eligibility Criteria.  
Based  on  the  Outputs  in  the  Sample  for  each  Pilot  Local 
Government  that  meet  the  Eligibility  Criteria,  BPKP  shall 
calculate  the  Qualifying  Percentage  for  that  Pilot  Local 
Government for that Fiscal Year. 

BPKP shall calculate the Value of Qualifying Reimbursement 
for  each  Pilot  Local  Government  for  that  Fiscal  Year  by 
multiplying the Qualifying Percentage by the Value of Potential 
Reimbursement.  
 

 

15 

(vii)  BPKP shall calculate the Value of Total Reimbursement  that 
may be  made by the Bank to the Borrower for that Fiscal Year 
which  shall  be 
the  Value  of  Qualifying 
Reimbursement for all Pilot Local Governments.   
 

the  sum  of 

(ix) 

(viii)  BPKP shall calculate the Value of Final Reimbursement  that 
may be made by the Bank to the Borrower for that Fiscal Year, 
by  subtracting  the  Advance  Payment  made  in  that  Fiscal  Year 
from the Value of Total Reimbursement. 
 
BPKP  shall  calculate  the  LG  Reimbursement  for  each  Pilot 
Local  Government  by  multiplying  the  Value  of  Qualifying  
Reimbursement  for  that  Pilot  Local  Government  for  that  Fiscal 
Year  by  ten  percent  (10%);  it  being  understood  that  this 
percentage  may,  by  prior  written  agreement  between  the 
Borrower  and  the  Bank,  be  revised  for  the  purposes  of 
calculating  the  LG  Reimbursement.      Upon  receipt  by  the 
Borrower of Reimbursement from the Bank in any Fiscal Year, 
the  MOF  shall  transfer  to  each  Pilot  Local  Government  its 
respective LG Reimbursement. 
 
Notwithstanding 
of  Total 
Reimbursement made by the Bank to the Borrower in any Fiscal 
Year shall in no event exceed the Annual DAK Allocation made 
by the Borrower for such Fiscal Year plus 10% (attributable to a 
portion of the LG Contribution).

Set-Off.    In  the  event  that  the  amount  of  the  Advance  Payment  in  any 
Fiscal Year exceeded the amount eligible for reimbursement by the Bank 
(the Value of Total Reimbursement) at the end of the Fiscal Year as set 
out in the Verification Report for that Fiscal Year, then the amount of the 
Advance Payment will be reduced in the subsequent Fiscal Year by the 
amount  of  overpayment  in  that  Fiscal  Year  (Advance  Payment  minus 
Value  of  Total  Reimbursement).   The  Bank  may,  by  notice  to  the 
Borrower,  reduce  the  amount  of  the  Advance  Payment,  or  decline  to 
provide  any  Advance  Payment,  for  any  subsequent  year  of  Project 
implementation  in  the  event  that  this  clause  was  invoked  in  any  Fiscal 
Year. 

  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing 
Review  of  Verification  Reports. 
provisions of this paragraph 5, the Bank retains the right to review any 
Verification  Report  and,  based  on  such  review,  to  not  disburse,  or  to 
disburse a lesser amount of the proceeds of the Loan for, any particular 
requested Advance Payment or Reimbursement.

if the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at any  time  that  any  Outputs  did  not 
comply  with  the  Technical  Guidelines  or  the  Supplemental  Guidelines 
(Environmental and Social Safeguards) or that a Pilot Local Government 
has  failed  to  deliver  all  the  Outputs  of  a  Sub-project,  the  Bank  may  at 
that time: (A) in any year of Project implementation except the last year, 
offset  future  Advance  Payments  and/or  Reimbursements  by  the  amount 
equal to the amount of Loan proceeds disbursed to finance Outputs not 
delivered by such Pilot Local Government; or (B) obtain a refund to the 
Bank  from  the  Borrower  of  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  Loan 
proceeds disbursed to finance Outputs not delivered by such Pilot Local 
Government.    Refunds to the  Bank  pursuant to  sub-paragraph (B)  shall 
be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement, 
including the General Conditions.  

The  Verification  Report  shall  provide  reasonable  details  satisfactory  to 
the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  of  any  cases  of  corrupt  practice,  collusive 
practice, fraudulent practice, coercive practice or obstructive practice (in 
each case as defined in the Anti-Corruption Guidelines) which come to 
BPKP’s  attention in  the  carrying  out  of  the  activities  set  out in the  VO 
Terms of Reference.

Work  Plan  and  documentation  of  TA  Funds  for  the  period       
July 1 – December 31, 2010 in accordance with paragraph 2(a) 
or  (b),  respectively,  of  Section  I.C  of  this  Schedule,  then  the 
Bank  will  not  make  any  Advance  Payment  or  Reimbursement 
for Outputs produced in Fiscal Year 2011; and  

 
(ii)  

for each Fiscal Year beginning with Fiscal Year 2011, if either of 
the  PIU  or  BPKP  has  not  provided  the  Work  Plan  and 
documentation of TA Funds or BPKP budget in accordance with 
paragraph  3(a)  or  (b),  respectively,  of  Section  I.C  of  this

of this Schedule.

the principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated

following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
