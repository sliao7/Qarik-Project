All withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit 
Account. 

(c)

The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used

the objectives of the Program, and, within 90 days after such notice, the Borrower 
shall not have achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the Bank, or the 
macroeconomic framework has not become consistent with the objectives of the Program, 
as the case may be, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan or any part thereof.
