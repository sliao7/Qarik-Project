multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b)

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such 
withdrawal  in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original 
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two (2) calendar months prior to

the principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated 
as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
4. 
Currency  Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 
on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be 
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate.
