goods  and  works  shall  be  procured  under  contracts  awarded  on  the  basis  of  National 
Competitive Bidding subject to the following additional procedures:

B. 

1. 

 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d)  

Before  issuing  any  invitation  to  bid,  the  Recipient  shall  prepare  and  furnish  or 
cause to be prepared and furnished to the Bank for approval, appropriate model 
bidding  documents.    Once  approved  by  the  Bank,  the  Recipient  shall  use,  or 
cause to be used, said model bidding documents, as approved for bidding under 
the  Project.  Any  change  or  departure  from  the  model  approved  shall  require 
Bank’s prior approval.  

All  bidders,  irrespective  of  whether  they  are  foreigners  or  Colombians,  will  be 
treated equally and, particularly, no preference will be granted to any bidder or 
group of bidders for bid evaluation purposes.  Bidders shall be allowed to submit 
their bids by hand or through the post office or private mailing services.  There 
shall  not  be  any  requirement  for  any  bidder  to  show  evidence  of  the  bidder's 
registration  in  any  public  registry,  chamber  of  commerce  or  similar  entity, 
whether in the Beneficiary’s territory or elsewhere, or to appoint a representative 
domiciled in the Beneficiary’s territory, unless and until such bidder is awarded 
the corresponding contract. 

Bids  shall  be  opened  in  a  public  meeting  to  which  bidders  and  their 
representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and place for 
the  opening  meeting  shall  be  set  forth  in  the  bidding  documents.  Bid  opening 
shall  coincide  with,  or take  place  promptly  after, the  final  date  and time  of  the 
period for bid submission stipulated in the bidding documents. 

Each  bid  shall  be  evaluated  and  the  corresponding  contract  awarded  to  the 
responsive  bidder  who  meets  appropriate  technical  and  financial  standards  of 
capability  and  whose  bid  has  been  determined  to  be  the  lowest  evaluated  bid. 
Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the specifications, 
conditions  and  evaluation  criteria  stipulated  in  the  bidding  documents.  If  any 
factor additional to the amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid 
evaluation, such factor or factors and the quantified manner in which they will be 
applied  for  purposes  of  determining  the  lowest  evaluated  bid  shall  be  precisely 
stipulated  in  the  bidding  documents.  For  purposes  of  bid  evaluation  and 
comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor shall be the 

 

-10- 

bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, including correction 
of arithmetic errors. 

(e) 

The  provisions  of  paragraph  2.7  of  the  Guidelines  shall  fully  apply  and,  more 
specifically,  bids  shall  not  be  disclosed  to  persons  other  than  the  persons 
officially  charged  with  the  task  of  comparing  and/or  evaluating  the  bids  while 
they  are  performing  their  official  duties,  without  the  corresponding  bidder’s 
written  authorization.  Moreover,  bidders  shall  not  be  required  to  provide  such 
authorization as a condition to be entitled to bid. This confidentiality requirement 
shall  apply  until  the  award  of  contract  is  notified  to  the  successful  bidder.  
Thereafter,  confidentiality  of  the  bids  shall  be  limited  to  those  bid  portions  for 
which confidentiality has been specifically requested by the bidder in question. 

Other Methods of Procurement of Goods and Works. The following table specifies 
the  methods  of  procurement,  other  than  National  Competitive  Bidding,  which  may  be

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment  Share”)  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion 
applies.

amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and 
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of 
such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved 
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction 
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
