Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains 
unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment  continues  for  a  period  of  thirty  days,  then  the

Bank may otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not amend or fail to enforce any 
provision of the Contrato de Mandato. In case of any conflict between the terms
