Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be repaid  on
each Principal  Payment  Date falling  after the  date  of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the Bank  by multiplying  the amount of each such withdrawal  by a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is the original Installment  Share specified  in the
table in  paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on or  after  such
date,  such amounts repayable  to be adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on any Principal  Payment  Date, be treated  as withdrawn  and outstanding
on the  second Principal  Payment  Date following  the date of withdrawal  and shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if at  any
time the Bank adopts  a due  date billing system under which invoices are issued on

-19-

or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion by  either:  (a) the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved Currency payable  by  the Bank under  the Currency Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (b)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with the  Conversion
Guidelines, the  exchange rate  component  of the Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule shall apply  separately to the amount  denominated  in each Loan
Currency, so as to  produce a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such amount.
