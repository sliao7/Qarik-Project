The following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal  Payment  Date, the principal  amount  of the Loan
repayable  by  the Borrower on each Principal  Payment  Date shall  be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for each Principal  Payment  Date, such
repayable  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts  referred  to
in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule, to  which a  Currency Conversion  applies.

Principal Payment Date 

On each  June  15  and December  15

Installment  Share
(Expressed  as  a Percentage)

2.63%

2.69%

2. 

If the proceeds  of the  Loan have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of the  first Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date shall be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds  of the Loan  have been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank  by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule, to  which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

-10-

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn within  two  calendar months  prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and  shall be  repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank  adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to  any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all or  any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on any Principal  Payment Date  occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to  the Conversion by  either:  (i)  the exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to  the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
the  Bank  so  determines 
exchange rate component  of the  Screen Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than one Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the amount  denominated
in each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each
such amount.
