accordance with the provisions of the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing
Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guide-
lines). For complex, time-based assignments, such contracts shall be
based on the standard form of contract for consultants’ services issued

apply to (a) contracts for the employment of consulting firms estimated
to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each or (b) contracts for the
employment of individual consultants estimated to cost less than $50,000
equivalent each. However, said exceptions to prior Bank review shall not
apply to (a) the terms of reference for such contracts, (b) single-
source selection of consulting firms, (c) assignments of a critical
nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank, (d) amendments to contracts
for the employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to

               this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect

               each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
               Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
               into the respective Special Account such amount as
               the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have
               been shown by said documents and other evidence to
               have been paid out of the respective Special Account
               for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be
               withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the

evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.

5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into any
Special Account:

     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

     (b)  if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,

Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the
Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records
and accounts for the Special Accounts;

     (c)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

     (d)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Categories for the respective Special Account minus the
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with
respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the
amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the
Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as
the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further with-
drawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the
respective Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment
out of any Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an
amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii)
was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional
evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the respective
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof
not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no
further deposit by the Bank into any Special Account shall be made
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or
refund, as the case may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in any Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments or eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank
all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts.

     (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
