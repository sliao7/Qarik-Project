Notwithstanding the provisions of Part B.1(c) of this Section, the Borrower may 
withdraw an amount not to exceed the equivalent of $14,000,000 as an advance for 
Categories 1 and 2; provided, however, in each case, that if the DLRs for said Categories,

determined by the Bank) to the Bank promptly upon notice thereof by the Bank. Except 
as otherwise agreed with the Borrower, the Bank shall cancel the amount so refunded.

only on such terms and conditions as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. 

3. (cid:9)

Notwithstanding the provisions of Part B.1(c) of this Section: 

If the Borrower has partially achieved any DLR under Category (2), the Bank 
may authorize the withdrawal of a portion of the amount of the Loan then 
allocated to said DLR, provided that the number of kilometers maintained under 
the pertinent DLR shall have exceeded the DLR Baseline, which portion of the 
Loan amount to be withdrawn shall be calculated in accordance with the formula 
set forth in the additional disbursement instructions referred to in Section IV.A.1 
(the "Disbursement Letter"). 

If any DLR under Category (2) has not been achieved or has been partially 
achieved (and, as a result of which a portion of the Loan has been withdrawn

Borrower, decide in its sole discretion to: (i) authorize the withdrawal of the 
unwithdrawn portion of Loan proceeds then allocated to said DLR, at such later

Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies.

(b)

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original 
Installment Share") and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies.

(a) (cid:9)

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and

withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

(cid:9)
(b) (cid:9)

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 
provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
