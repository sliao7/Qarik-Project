the proceeds of the Loan, with each withdrawal valued by the Bank as of
the date of such withdrawal.

     Section 2.02. (a) The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to
the Bank the first request for withdrawal from the Loan Account, and
thereafter maintain in the National Bank, a deposit account in Dollars
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.  All withdrawals
from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit
Account.

     (c)  The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall
not be used to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions
of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at
any time that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been used to make a
payment for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower shall, promptly
upon notice from the Bank: (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an
amount equal to the amount of said payment; or (ii) if the Bank shall
so request, refund such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the
Bank upon such request shall be credited to the Loan Account for

3.01 of this Agreement based on evidence satisfactory to the Bank: (i)
with the progress achieved by the Borrower in the carrying out of the
Program; and (ii) that the actions described in Schedule 3 to this
Agreement have been taken. If, after said exchange of views, the Bank
shall have given notice to the Borrower that the progress achieved and
actions taken are not satisfactory and, within ninety (90) days after
such notice, the Borrower shall not have achieved progress and taken
actions satisfactory to the Bank, then the Bank may, by notice to the
Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn amount of the Loan or any part thereof.

     Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be March 31, 1997, or such
later date as the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify
the Borrower of such later date.

     Section 2.04. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment
charge at the rate of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per

determined in respect of the preceding Semester, plus one-half of one
percent (1/2 of 1%). On each of the dates specified in Section 2.06 of
this Agreement, the Borrower shall pay interest accrued on the principal
amount outstanding during the preceding Interest Period, calculated at
the rate applicable during such Interest Period.

               such borrowings or portions thereof as the Bank has
               allocated to fund: (A) the Bank’s investments; and (B)
               loans which may be made by the Bank after July 1, 1989

this Section shall be amended to read as follows:

          "(a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount
          of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at
