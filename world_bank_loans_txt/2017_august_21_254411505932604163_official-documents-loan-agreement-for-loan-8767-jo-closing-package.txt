of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have  been fully withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a)  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the
Installment  Share  for each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount to  be adjusted,

table  in  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months  prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and outstanding
on the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date of withdrawal.

-16-

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the  Bank adopts  a due date  billing system  under which invoices  are  issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to  any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all  or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan  Balance to  an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,  shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (a)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (b)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines, the  exchange  rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount  denominated in each  Loan
Currency,  so as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each such  amount.
