the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
Payment Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share  for each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such

Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan withdrawn  within two  calendar  months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the  date of withdrawal  and shall  be  repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b)

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing  system under which  invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
such
of 
sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the
adoption  of such  billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than one  Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the  amount  denominated
in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
