(a) 
National Competitive Bidding.  In addition, the procedures to be followed for 
National  Competitive  Bidding  shall  be  those  set  forth  in  the  Law  on  Tendering  and 
Bidding  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  promulgated  by  Order  No.21  of  the 
President of the People’s Republic of China on August 30, 1999, with the following 
clarifications required for compliance with the Procurement Guidelines: 
 

All  invitations  to  prequalify  or  to  bid  shall  be  advertised  in  a 
newspaper  of  national  circulation  in  the  Borrower’s  country,  except 
for civil works contracts that are estimated cost less than $2,000,000 
equivalent each and for goods contracts that are estimated to cost less 
than  $300,000  equivalent  each,  which  may  be  advertised  in  a 
provincial  daily  newspaper.  Such  advertisement  shall  be  made  in 
sufficient  time  for  prospective  bidders  to  obtain  prequalification  or 
bidding  documents  and  prepare  and  submit  their  responses.    In  any 
event,  a  minimum  of  thirty  (30)  days  shall  be  given  to  bidders

Qualification  requirements  of  bidders  and  the  method  of  evaluating 
the  qualification  of  each  bidder  shall  be  specified  in  detail  in  the

All  bidders  that  meet  the  qualification  criteria  set  out  in  the  pre-
qualification  document  shall  be  allowed  to  bid and there  shall  be  no 
limit on the number of pre-qualified bidders. 

All  bidders  shall  be  required  to  provide  security  in  an  amount 
sufficient to protect the Borrower or the Project Implementing Entity, 
as the case may be, in case of breach of contract by the contractor, and 
the bidding documents shall specify the required form and amount of 
such security.

required to be present at the bid opening. 

 
(vii)  All bid evaluation criteria shall be disclosed in the bidding documents 
and quantified in monetary terms or expressed in the form of pass/fail

outside  any  standard  contract  estimate,  or  margin  or  bracket  of 
average bids established by the Borrower or the Project Implementing 
Entity, as the case may be. 

Each  contract  shall  be  awarded  to  the  lowest  evaluated  responsive 
bidder,  that  is,  the  bidder  who  meets  the  appropriate  standards  of 
capability  and  resources  and  whose  bid  has  been  determined:  (A)  to 
be substantially responsive to the bidding documents; and (B) to offer 
the lowest evaluated cost.  The winning bidder shall not be required, 
as  a  condition  of  award,  to  undertake  responsibilities  for  work  not 
stipulated in the bidding documents or otherwise to modify the bid as 
originally submitted. 

Each  contract  financed  with  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  provide 
that the suppliers and contractors shall permit the Bank, at its request, 
to  inspect  their  accounts  and  records  relating  to  the  performance  of 
the contract and to have said accounts and records audited by auditors 
appointed by the Bank. 

Government  owned  enterprises  in  the  Borrower’s  country  may  be 
permitted to bid or submit a proposal of goods and works if they can 
establish  that  they:  (i)  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous;  (ii)
