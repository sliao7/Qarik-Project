SCHEDULE  4

Amortization Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan  have been  fully
withdrawn  as  of the first Principal  Payment Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each Principal  Payment Date shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  by (b) the Installment  Share  for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts  referred to
in paragraph  4 of this Schedule,  to which a  Currency Conversion applies.

(a) 

To the  extent that any proceeds  of the Loan have been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of such
withdrawal  in amounts determined  by the  Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to which a Currency
Conversion  applies.

Amounts  of the  Loan withdrawn  within two  calendar months prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and shall  be repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a  due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment  Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption  of such billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all or  any  portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment  Date occurring during the  Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of

- 19  -

denomination  immediately  prior to  the Conversion by  either:  (i)  the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in  more than one  Loan  Currency,
the  provisions of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount  denominated
in each Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a separate amortization  schedule for each
such amount.
