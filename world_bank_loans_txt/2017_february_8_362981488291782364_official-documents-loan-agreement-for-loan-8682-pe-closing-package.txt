The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the Loan  and  the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment Share").  If the proceeds of the  Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as of the  first Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b) the  Installment

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower  shall  repay the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as
of such date  in  accordance  with paragraph  I of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after the  date of such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such withdrawal  by  a
fraction, the  numerator  of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct any  amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  (2)  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of
withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing
with the second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date of withdrawal.

or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption  of such
billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance to  an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date  occurring during the Conversion  Period,  shall be determined  by the Bank  by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i) the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the  exchange rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.
