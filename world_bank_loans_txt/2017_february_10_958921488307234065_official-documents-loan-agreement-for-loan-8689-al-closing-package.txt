withdrawn  as of the first  Principal  Payment  Date, the principal  amount of the  Loan
repayable  by  the  Borrower on each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be determined  by

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such

Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original

withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date  of withdrawal.

are issued on or after the  respective  Principal  Payment Date,  the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer  apply to any  withdrawals  made after
the adoption  of such  billing  system.
