(C) 

the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  intend,  to  the  extent  practicable,  that  the

WHEREAS  the  Bank  has  agreed,  on  the  basis,  inter  alia, of the  foregoing,  to

Special Account shall be made as follows: 

-15- 

(a) 

if the Borrower is not making Report-based Disbursements, withdrawals

if  the  Borrower  is  making  Report-based  Disbursements,  withdrawals 

3.

Expenditures.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the 
Borrower  shall,  at  such  time  as  the  Bank  shall  reasonably  request,  furnish  to  the  Bank 
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
Eligible Expenditures. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of Part B.2 of this Schedule, the Bank shall not 

4. 
be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:  

(a) 

if the Bank, at any time, is not satisfied that the reports referred to in Part 
 
A.4  of  this  Schedule  1  adequately  provide  the  information  required  for  Report-based 
Disbursements;  

(b) 

if  the  Bank  determines  at  any  time  that  all  further  withdrawals  for 
 
payment  of  Eligible  Expenditures  should  be  made  by  the  Borrower  directly  from  the 
Loan Account; or 

(c) 

 
if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period 
of  time  specified  in  Section  4.01  (b)  (ii)  of  this  Agreement,  any  of  the  audit  reports 
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of: 
(A)  the  records  and  accounts  for  the  Special  Account;  or  (B)  the  records  and  accounts 
reflecting  expenditures  with  respect 
to  which  withdrawals  were  Report-based 
Disbursements or were made on the basis of statements of expenditure, as the case may 
be.  

5. 
The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account 
in accordance with the provisions of Part B.2 of this Schedule if, at any time, the Bank 
shall have notified the Borrower and the Guarantor of its intention to suspend in whole or 
in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to 
Section  6.02  of  the  General  Conditions.    Upon  such  notification,  the  Bank  shall 
determine, in its sole discretion, whether further deposits into the Special Account may 
be  made  and  what  procedures  should  be  followed  for  making  such  deposits,  and  shall 
notify the Borrower and the Guarantor of its determination. 

(a) 

6. 
If the Bank determines at any time that any payment out of the Special 
Account was made for an expenditure which is not an Eligible Expenditure, or was not 

-16- 

justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice 
from the Bank, provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request, or deposit into 
the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal 
to the amount of such payment.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit 
by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) 

 
If  the  Bank  determines  at  any  time  that  any  amount  outstanding  in  the 
Special Account will not be required to cover payments for Eligible Expenditures during 
the  six-month  period  following  such  determination,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon 
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or 

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

paragraph  6  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement.

Annex A 
to 
SCHEDULE 1 
 
Operation of Special Account 
When Withdrawals Are Not  
Report-based Disbursements 

 

For  the  purposes  of  this  Annex,  the  term  “Authorized  Allocation”  means  the 
1. 
amount  of  $1,000,000  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the 
Special  Account  pursuant  to  paragraph  3  (a)  of  this  Schedule;  provided,  however,  that 
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to the 
amount of $500,000 until the Bank determines based on the amounts and frequencies of 
withdrawals applications that a higher balance is necessary. 

Withdrawals  of  the  Authorized  Allocation  and  subsequent  withdrawals  to 

2. 
replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:  

(a) 

 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the  Bank  a request  or requests  for  deposit  into  the  Special  Account of an amount  or 
amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of 
each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan 
Account and  deposit into  the  Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall have 
requested.  

(b) 

 
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank requests for deposit into the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall 
specify.    Prior to  or at the  time  of  each  such  request,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the 
Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant to Part B.3 of Schedule 1 to 
this  Agreement  for  the  payment  or  payments  in  respect  of  which  replenishment  is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as 
the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures. 
Each  such  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  withdrawn  by  the  Bank  from  the 
Loan Account under one or more of the Eligible Categories. 

3. 
The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account, 
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan minus the total amount of all outstanding 
special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General 
Conditions shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 

-18- 

the  Loan  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank  shall  specify  by  notice  to  the 
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special 
Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  Eligible 
Expenditures.

Account under one or more of the Eligible Categories.  

2. 
Upon  receipt  of  each application for  withdrawal  of  an  amount  of the  Loan, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into 
the Special Account an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount so requested; and (b) 
the amount which the Bank has determined, based on the reports referred to in Part A.4 of 
this Schedule 1 applicable to such withdrawal application, is required to be deposited in 
order to finance Eligible Expenditures during the six-month period following the date of 
such reports.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
1. 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 
the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 
Date,  such  repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2.  
If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  not  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) 

Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original 
Installment  Share)  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(a) 

3. 
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 

-22- 

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if  at  any  time  the  Bank  shall adopt  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which invoices  are 
issued  on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such 
subparagraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system.  

4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period, 
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate.  

5. 
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall  be  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule 
shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
