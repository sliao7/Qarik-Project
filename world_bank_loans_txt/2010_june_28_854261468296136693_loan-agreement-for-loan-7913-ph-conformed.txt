INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION 
AND DEVELOPMENT 
 

Dated June 28, 2010 
 

LOAN AGREEMENT 

AGREEMENT  dated  June  28,  2010,  entered  into  between  the  REPUBLIC  OF 
THE  PHILIPPINES  (“the  Borrower”)  and  the  INTERNATIONAL  BANK  FOR 
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (“the Bank”) for the purpose of providing 
supplemental  financing  in  support  of  the  Program  (as  defined  in  the  appendix  to  this 
Agreement). The Bank has decided to provide this supplemental financing on the basis, 
inter  alia,  of    (a)  the  actions  which  the  Borrower  has  already  taken  under  the  Program 
which  are  described  in  the  Original  Loan  Agreement,  and  repeated  in  Section  I  of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement for ease of reference, (b) the Borrower’s maintenance of an 
appropriate  macro-economic  policy  framework;  and  (c)  the  Borrower’s  request  for 
supplemental financing to help in meeting the Program’s increased funding requirements 
caused by the impact of the typhoons that hit the Borrower’s territory in September and 
October 2009.  The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 

1.01.  The  General  Conditions  (as  defined  in  the  Appendix  to  this  Agreement) 

constitute an integral part of this Agreement. 

 
1.02.  Unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  the  capitalized  terms  used  in  this 
Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Conditions or in 
the Appendix to this Agreement. 

ARTICLE II — LOAN 

2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or 
referred to in this Agreement, an amount of two hundred and fifty million Dollars 
($250,000,000), as such amount  may be converted from time to time through a 
Currency  Conversion  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Section  2.07  of  this 
Agreement (“Loan”). 

2.02.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program 

in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement. 

2.03.  The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of one 

percent (0.25%) of the Loan amount. 

2.04.  The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate 
equal to LIBOR for the Loan Currency plus the Variable Spread; provided that, 
upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the 

2

interest payable by the Borrower during the Conversion Period on such amount 
shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of 
the  General  Conditions.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the 
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains  unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment 
continues for a period of thirty days, then the interest payable by the Borrower 
shall  instead  be  calculated  as  provided  in  Section  3.02(d)  of  the  General 
Conditions. 

2.05.  The Payment Dates are May 15 and November 15 in each year. 

2.06.  The  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  shall  be  repaid  in  accordance  with  the 

amortization schedule set forth in Schedule 2 to this Agreement. 

2.07.

amount  of  the  Loan,  withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved 
Currency; (ii) a change of the interest rate basis applicable to all or any 
portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding 
from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice versa; and (iii) the setting 
of  limits  on  the  Variable  Rate  applicable  to  all  or  any  portion  of  the 
principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  by  the 
establishment  of  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or  Interest  Rate  Collar  on  the 
Variable Rate. 

(b) 

(c) 

Any conversion requested pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section that 
is accepted by the Bank shall be considered a “Conversion”, as defined 
in the General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the 
provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion 
Guidelines.  

Promptly  following  the  Execution  Date  for  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or 
Interest  Rate  Collar  for  which  the  Borrower  has  requested  that  the 
premium  be  paid  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan,  the  Bank  shall,  on 
behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to 
itself  the  amounts  required  to  pay  any  premium  payable  in  accordance

allocated from time to time for the purpose in the table in Section II of 
Schedule 2 to this Agreement.
