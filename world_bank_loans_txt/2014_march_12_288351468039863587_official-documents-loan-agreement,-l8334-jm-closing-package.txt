SCHEDULE  3

Amortization Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the Loan have  been  fully
withdrawn  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
determined  by the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b) the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal
Payment  Date, such  repayable  amount to be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion applies.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the
withdrawal 
amount  of each  such withdrawal  by a fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is
the  original  Installment Share  specified  in the  table in paragraph  I of this
Schedule  for said Principal  Payment Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred to  in paragraph  4 of this Schedule,  to which a  Currency
Conversion applies.

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn within  two calendar months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any Principal  Payment Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each
Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the second  Principal  Payment
Date  following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its
currency  of denomination  immediately  prior  to the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the
Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component of the Screen Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in  more  than  one Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the amount  denominated
in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for
