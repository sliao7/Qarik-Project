the percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the 
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
determined by the  Bank  by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance  as of the 
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency 
Conversion applies.

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 

(a) 
To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of  the  Loan  have  been 
withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower 
shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in 
accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 
 
(b) 
Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment 
Date shall  be  repaid on  each  Principal Payment  Date  falling after 
the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by 
multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the 
numerator  of  which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in

Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) and the denominator 
of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares 
for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such 
amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any 
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a 
Currency Conversion applies. 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior 
to  any  Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of 
calculating  the  principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal 
Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the 
second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of  withdrawal 
and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date 
commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following 
the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this 
paragraph, if at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system 
under which invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal 
Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no 
longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of  such 
billing system.  

 
4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule, 
upon a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that 
is  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its 
currency  of denomination immediately  prior  to the  Conversion  by  either:  (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  
 
5. 
If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan 
Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount 
denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization 
schedule for each such amount.
