Principal  Payment  Date,  the principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment

If the proceeds  of the Loan  have not been  fully withdrawn  as of the first Principal  Payment

Payment Date shall  be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the  extent  that any  proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of  the  first
Principal  Payment Date, the Borrower  shall repay  the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the date  of such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying the  amount  of each  such withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is  the original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the
table  in  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct any  amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn within two  calendar months  prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as withdrawn  and  outstanding
on  the second  Principal  Payment Date following  the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sub-paragraph  (a)  of  this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the Bank adopts a  due date  billing system under which  invoices  are  issued on

paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made  after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan  Balance  to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion  Period, shall  be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
