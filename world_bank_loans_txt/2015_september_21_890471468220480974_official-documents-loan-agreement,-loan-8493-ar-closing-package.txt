Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn within  two  calendar months prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as

the  adoption of such billing  system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the  Conversion by  either:  (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.
