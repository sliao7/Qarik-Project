withdrawn as  of the first Principal Payment  Date, the principal amount of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower  on each Principal Payment  Date shall be  determined by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date; by (b)  the Installment  Share  for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount to  be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct any amounts  referred  to

To the extent  that any proceeds  of the Loan  have been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn within two calendar months  prior to any

following  the  date of withdrawal  and shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion of all or any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the Conversion by either:  (a) the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to the Conversion;  or  (b)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
