Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such

Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")

Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion applies.

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two calendar  months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date  of withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date  billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such  sub-paragraph  shall no  longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption  of such billing  system.

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to  the Conversion  by  either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii) if
the  Bank  so  determines 
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to  the  amount  denominated
in each  Loan  Currency,  so as  to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
