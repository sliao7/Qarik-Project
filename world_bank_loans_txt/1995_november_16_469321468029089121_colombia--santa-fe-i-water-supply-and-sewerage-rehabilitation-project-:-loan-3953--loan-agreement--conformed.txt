bidders  for bid evaluation  purposes. Bidders shall be allowed to submit their bids  by hand

for  any  bidder  to  show  evidence  of the  bidder's  registration  in  any  public  registry,
chamber  of commerce  or  similar,  whether  in  Colombia  or  elsewhere,  or  to  appoint  a

and  whose  bid has  been  determined  to be  the  lowest  evaluated  bid.  Such  determination
shall  be  made  exclusively  on  the  basis  of the  specifications,  conditions  and  evaluation
criteria  stipulated  in  the  bidding  documents.  If any  factor  additional  to  the  amount  or
amounts  of each  bid  is to be  considered  in  bid evaluation,  such factor  or factors  and the
quantified  manner on which  they will  be  applied for  purposes  of determining the  lowest

bid  evaluation  and  comparison,  the  only  bid  amount  or  amounts  to  be  used  as  a factor
shall be the bid  amount or  amounts  as quoted  in corresponding  bid,  including  correction

official duties, without the corresponding bidder's written authorization. Moreover, bidders
shall  not  be  required  to  provide  such  authorization  as  a  condition  to  be  entitled  to  bid.
This confidentiality  requirement  shall  apply  until the  award  of contract  is notified to the
successful  bidder.  Thereafter,  confidentiality  of the  bids  shall  be  limited  to  those  bid
portions  for  which  confidentiality  has  been  specifically  requested  by  the  bidder  in
question.

Borrower  shall  employ  such  consultants  under  contracts  using  the  standard  form  of
contract  for  consultants'  services  issued  by  the  Bank,  with  such  modifications  as  shall
have  been agreed  by the Bank. Where  no relevant standard contract documents  have been
issued  by  the Bank,  the  Borrower  shall  use  other  standard  forms  agreed with  the Bank.

be.

(b) 

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding

expenditures, the Borrower  shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund  to the Bank
such outstanding  amount.

(c)
