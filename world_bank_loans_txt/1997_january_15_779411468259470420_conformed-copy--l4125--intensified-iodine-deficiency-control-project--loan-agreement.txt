          time, the Bank determines, after consultation with the

          the Borrower having taken timely and appropriate action
          satisfactory to the Bank to remedy the situation, and
          establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of
          such contract which would otherwise have been eligible

          which would otherwise have been eligible for financing
          out of the proceeds of the Loan, or (e) after the

          unwithdrawn from the Loan Account, or (f) the Bank

          to Section 6.07 with respect to an amount of the Loan,
          the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the
          Guarantor, terminate the right of the Borrower to make
          withdrawals with respect to such amount.  Upon the

the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account:

          (i)  was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
               eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule;
               or

         (ii)  was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
               Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from
               the Bank:

               (A)  provide such additional evidence as the Bank
                    may request; or

                    amount equal to the amount of such payment or
                    the portion thereof not so eligible or
                    justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
                    agree, no further deposit by the Bank into
                    the Special Account shall be made until the
                    Borrower has provided such evidence or made
                    such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.

and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
