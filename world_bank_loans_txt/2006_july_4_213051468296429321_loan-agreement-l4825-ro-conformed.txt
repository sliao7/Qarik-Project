SCHEDULE 2 
 
Mandatory for Procurement under Bank-Financed Contracts Subject to National 
Competitive Bidding 
 

Contracts for goods or works for which the Loan Agreement allows procurement 
under  paragraphs  3.3  and  3.4  of  the  Procurement  Guidelines  may  be  procured  in 
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  national  laws  and  regulations  with  the  following 
exceptions: 

 
Procedures

A. 

An  open  competitive  procedure  shall  be  followed  in  all  cases,  irrespective  of 
contract value.  Foreign firms shall not be excluded and eligibility requirements shall be 
common  for  national  and  foreign  bidders,  with  no  preference  of  any  kind  given  to 
national  bidders  or  bidders  from  any  regional  market.    Invitations  to  bid  shall  be 
advertised  in  at least one (1)  widely  circulated  national  daily  newspaper  or  the Official 
Gazette, allowing  a  minimum  of  thirty  (30)  days  for the  preparation  and  submission of 
bids.  Adequate response time shall be provided for preparation and submission of bids.  

 
Assessment of Bidders’ Qualifications

B. 

Prior  registration  shall  not  be  required  to  participate  in  bidding  procedures.  
When pre-qualification shall be required for large or complex works, invitations to pre-
qualify for bidding shall be advertised in at least one (1) widely circulated national daily 
newspaper or the Official Gazette,  allowing a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the 
deadline  for  the  submission  of  pre-qualification  applications.    Minimum  experience, 
technical  and  financial  requirements  shall  be  explicitly  stated  in  the  pre-qualification 
documents, which shall be determined by a ‘pass/fail’ method, not through use of a merit 
point system.  Prequalification shall be based entirely upon the capability and resources 
of prospective bidders to perform the particular contract satisfactorily, taking into account 
their  experience  and  past  performance  on  similar  contracts,  capabilities  with  respect  to 
personnel, equipment and construction or manufacturing facilities, and financial position, 
and  all  applicants  that  meet  the  specified  criteria  shall  be  allowed  to  bid.    Where  pre-
qualification is not used, the qualifications of the bidder who is recommended for award 
of  contract  shall  be  assessed  by  post-qualification,  applying  minimum  experience, 
technical  and  financial  requirements  which  shall  be  explicitly  stated  in  the  bidding 
documents.    All  qualification  criteria so  specified in the  pre-qualification  documents  or 
bidding documents, as the case may be, and only such qualification criteria, shall be used 
to determine whether a bidder is qualified. 

 

- 17 -

C. 

Participation by Government-owned Enterprises

Government-owned  enterprises  in  Romania  shall  be  eligible  to  participate  in 
bidding  only  if  they  can  establish  that  they  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous, 
operate  under  commercial  law  and  are  not  an  dependent  agency  of  the  contracting 
authority.    Furthermore,  they  will  be  subject  to  the  same  bid  and  performance  security 
requirements as other bidders. 
 
D. 

Bidding Documents

Procuring  entities  shall  use  the  appropriate  standard  bidding  documents  for  the 
procurement  of  goods,  works  or  services,  which  shall  contain  draft  contract  and 
conditions of contract acceptable to the Bank.  The bidding documents shall provide clear 
instructions on how bids should be submitted, how prices should be offered, and the place 
and  time  for  submission  and  opening  of  bids.    Standards  and  technical  specifications 
quoted  in  bidding  documents  shall  permit  the  broadest  possible  competition,  and 
wherever  national  standards  are  specified,  the  bidding  documents  shall  also  state  that 
equipment,  material,  or  workmanship  meeting  other  standards,  which  promise  at  least 
substantial equivalence, will also be accepted.  Bidding instructions shall clearly stipulate 
that  discount,  if  any,  must  be  stated  by  the  bidder  either  in  a  cover  letter  or  in  the  bid 
form.    In  case  of  joint  ventures,  bidding  conditions  shall  stipulate  joint  and  several 
liability of all the partners of the joint venture. 
 
E. 

Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation  criteria  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the  bidding  documents,  and 
evaluation criteria other than price shall be quantified in monetary terms.  All evaluation 
criteria so specified, and only such criteria, shall be taken into account in bid evaluation. 
 
F. 

Bid Submission, Opening and Evaluation, Award of Contract

(a) 

Bids  shall  be  submitted  in  a  single  envelope  containing  the  bidder’s 
qualification  information,  technical  and  price  bids,  which  shall  be  opened  at  the  public 
bid opening.  Should bids be submitted in two (2) or more envelopes, all envelopes shall 
be opened at the public bid opening. 

Bids  shall  be  opened  in  public  immediately  after  the  deadline  for 
submission of bids.  No bid shall be rejected during bid opening.  The name of the bidder, 
the total amount of each bid, and any discounts shall be read aloud and recorded in the 
minutes of the public bid opening.  Any discount not mentioned in the cover letter or bid 
form shall not be taken into account in the evaluation. 

The evaluation of bids shall be done in strict adherence to the monetarily 
quantifiable  criteria  specified  in  the  bidding  documents  and  a  merit  point  system  or 
scoring  on  the  basis  of  “technical  and  economical  financial  achievements”  shall  not  be

reservations  once  bids  have  been  opened.    Bidders  shall  not  be  eliminated  from  the 
detailed evaluation on the basis of non-material, minor deviations or reservations. 

Extension of bid validity shall be allowed once only for a maximum of 
thirty (30) days.  No further extensions should be requested without the prior approval of 
the Bank. 

Contracts  shall  be  awarded  to  qualified  bidders  having  submitted  the 

lowest evaluated substantially responsive bid. 

There  shall  be  no  negotiations,  even  with  the  lowest  evaluated  bidder, 
without the Bank’s prior concurrence.  A bidder shall not be required, as a condition of 
award,  to  undertake  obligations  not  specified  in  the  bidding  documents  or  otherwise  to 
modify the bid as originally submitted. 

The Borrower shall publish the following information on contract award 
on a free and open access website when it becomes operational or on another means of 
publication acceptable to the Bank: (i)  name of each bidder who submitted a bid; (ii) bid 
prices  as  read  out  at  bid  opening;  (iii)  name  and  evaluated  price  of  each  bid  that  was 
evaluated;  (iv)  names  of  bidders  whose  bids  were  rejected  and  the  reasons  for  the 
rejection; and (v) name of the winning bidder, price it offered as well as the duration and 
summary  scope  of  the  contract  awarded.    This  publication  will  be  updated  at  least 
quarterly.  

The Borrower shall declare a firm ineligible, either indefinitely or for a 
stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by the Bank and the Government, if it at 
any time determines that the firm has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, 
fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  in  competing  for,  or  in  executing,  a  Bank-
financed contract. 
 
G. 

Suppliers and Contractors

Bidding  documents  and  contracts  shall  include  a  provision  requiring  bidders  and
