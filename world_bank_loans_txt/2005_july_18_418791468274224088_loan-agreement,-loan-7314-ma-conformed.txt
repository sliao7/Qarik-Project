Section  2.02.  (a)  The  Borrower  shall  open,  prior  to  furnishing  to  the  Bank  the

-3- 

withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  shall  be  deposited  by  the  Bank  into  the  Deposit

(b) 

 
The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used

Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan

shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (i)  deposit  into  the  Deposit  Account  an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment; or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, refund 
such  amount  to  the  Bank.    Amounts  refunded  to  the  Bank  upon  such  request  shall  be 
credited to the Loan Account for cancellation. 

(c) 

 
No withdrawal shall be made from the Loan Account after the aggregate 
of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  shall  have  reached 
seventy  million  two  hundred  forty  thousand  five  hundred    Euros  (EUR  70,240,500), 
unless the Bank shall be satisfied, after an exchange of views as described in Section 3.01 
of  this  Agreement  based  on  evidence  satisfactory  to  the  Bank:  (i)  with  the  progress 
achieved by the Borrower in the carrying out of the Program; (ii) that the macroeconomic 
framework of the Borrower is satisfactory, and in line with the Program, as measured on 
the  basis  of  indicators  agreed  between  the  Borrower  and  the  Bank;  and  (iii)  that  the 
actions  described  in  Schedule  3  to  this  Agreement  have  been  taken.  If,  after  said 
exchange  of  views,  the  Bank  shall  have  given  notice  to  the  Borrower that  the progress 
achieved  and  actions taken  pursuant to (i),  (ii), and (iii)  above  are  not  satisfactory  and, 
within ninety (90) days after such notice, the Borrower shall not have achieved progress 
and taken actions satisfactory to the Bank, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, 
cancel the unwithdrawn amount of the Loan or any part thereof. 

Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be December 31, 2007 or such later date as 
the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later date.

percent  (1%)  of  the  amount  of  the  Loan.  On  or  promptly  after  the  Effective  Date,  the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and pay to itself 
the amount of said fee.  

 Section 2.05. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment charge on the 
principal  amount  of  the  Loan  not  withdrawn  from  time  to  time,  at  a  rate  equal  to:  
(i) eighty five one-hundredths of one per cent (0.85%) per annum from the date on which 
such charge commences to accrue in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.02 of 
the  General  Conditions  to  but  not  including  the  fourth  anniversary  of  such  date;  and  
(ii) seventy five one-hundredths of one per cent (0.75%) per annum thereafter. 

Section  2.06.  The  Borrower  shall  pay  interest  on  the  principal  amount  of  the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, in respect of each Interest Period at 
the Variable Rate; provided, that upon a Conversion of all or any portion of the principal 

 

-4- 

amount  of  the  Loan,  the  Borrower  shall,  during  the  Conversion  Period,  pay  interest  on 
such  amount  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  Article  IV  of  the  General 
Conditions. 

Section 2.07. Interest and commitment charges shall be payable semiannually in 

arrears on April 15 and October 15 in each year. 

Section  2.08.  The  Borrower  shall  repay  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  in

Conversions of the terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: 

(i) 

(ii)

a  change  of  the  Loan  Currency  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  principal 
amount  of  the  Loan,  withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved 
Currency;

principal  amount  of the  Loan  from  a  Variable  Rate to  a  Fixed  Rate,  or 
vice versa; and 

the setting of limits on the Variable Rate applicable to all or any portion 
of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  by  the 
establishment  of  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or  Interest  Rate  Collar  on  said 
Variable Rate. 

(b) 

Any conversion requested pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section that 
is accepted by the Bank shall be considered a “Conversion”, as defined in Section 2.01(7) 
of  the  General  Conditions,  and  shall  be  effected  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion Guidelines. 

(c) 

Promptly  following  the  Execution  Date  for  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or 
Interest Rate Collar in respect of which the Borrower has requested that the premium be 
paid out of the proceeds of the Loan, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from  the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to  itself  the  amounts  required  to  pay  any  premium

SCHEDULE 2 

Amortization Schedule 

1. 
The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the

Payment  Date,  such  repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  not  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first 
2.  
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) 

Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original 
Installment  Share)  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(a) 

3. 
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if  at  any  time  the  Bank  shall adopt  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which invoices  are 
issued  on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of  such 
billing system.  

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

-12- 

4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period, 
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
