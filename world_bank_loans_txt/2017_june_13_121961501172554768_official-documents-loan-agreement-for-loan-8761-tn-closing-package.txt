7",

AGREEMENT  dated 

2017,  entered  into  between
REPUBLIC  OF  TUNISIA 
("Borrower")  and  INTERNATIONAL  BANK  FOR
RECONSTRUCTION  AND  DEVELOPMENT  ("Bank")  for  the  purpose  of providing
financing in support  of the Program (as  defined in  the Appendix to this Agreement).  The
Bank has  decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of:  (i) the actions which
the Borrower has already taken under the Program and which are described  in Section  I of
Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement,  and  (ii)  the  Borrower's  maintenance  of  an  adequate
macroeconomic  policy framework.  The Borrower and the Bank therefore hereby  agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I - GENERAL  CONDITIONS;  DEFINITIONS

1.01. 

The General  Conditions (as defined  in the Appendix to  this Agreement) constitute
an integral part  of this Agreement.

1.02.  Unless the context requires  otherwise, the capitalized terms used in this Agreement
have the meanings ascribed to them in the General  Conditions or in the Appendix
to  this Agreement.

ARTICLE H - LOAN

2.01. 

The Bank agrees  to lend to the Borrower,  on the terms  and conditions  set  forth  or
referred  to  in this Agreement,  the amount of four hundred fifty-seven  million two
hundred  thousand  Euro  (E457,200,000), as  such  amount  may be converted  from
time to time through a  Currency  Conversion  in  accordance  with the  provisions of
Section  2.08  of this Agreement  ("Loan").

2.02.  The Borrower  may withdraw  the  proceeds  of the Loan in  support of the Program

in accordance  with Section II of Schedule  1 to this Agreement.

2.03.  The Front-end  Fee  payable by the  Borrower  shall  be equal  to  one  quarter of one

percent  (0.25%),  of the Loan amount.

2.04 

The Commitment  Charge payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of
one percent (0.25%)  per annum on the Unwithdrawn  Loan Balance.

2.05.  The  interest  payable  by  the  Borrower  for  each  Interest  Period  shall  be at  a  rate
equal  to  the  Reference  Rate  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Variable  Spread;
provided,  however, that  the interest  payable  shall  in  no  event be less  than
zero  percent  (0%)  per  annum;  and  provided  furthermore  that,  upon  a

-2-

Conversion of all  or any portion of the  principal amount  of the  Loan, the  interest
payable  by  the Borrower  during  the Conversion  Period  on  such  amount  shall  be
determined  in accordance  with the relevant  provisions of Article IV of the General
Conditions.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if any amount  of the Withdrawn Loan
Balance  remains unpaid when due and such non-payment  continues  for a period of
thirty days, then the interest payable by the Borrower  shall instead be  calculated as
provided  in Section  3.02  (e)  of the  General  Conditions.
2.06.  The Payment  Dates are March  15  and September  15  in each year.

2.07.  The  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  shall  be  repaid  in  accordance  with  the

2.08. 

(a) 

The  Borrower may at  any time  request  any of the  following Conversions
of the  terms  of the  Loan in  order  to  facilitate  prudent  debt  management:
(i) a  change  of the  Loan  Currency  of all  or  any portion  of the principal
amount  of  the  Loan,  withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved
Currency;  (ii)  a change  of the interest  rate  basis  applicable  to:  (A)  all  or
any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and
outstanding  from a Variable  Rate to  a Fixed Rate, or vice versa;  or (B) all
or  any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and
outstanding  from  a  Variable  Rate  based  on  a  Reference  Rate  and  the
Variable  Spread to  a Variable  Rate  based on a  Fixed Reference  Rate and
the Variable Spread, or vice versa;  or (C)  all of the principal amount of the
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable  Rate based on a Variable
Spread to  a Variable  Rate based on a Fixed Spread;  and (iii)  the setting of
limits on the  Variable  Rate  or the Reference  Rate  applicable  to  all or any
portion of the principal amount  of the  Loan withdrawn  and outstanding by
the  establishment  of an  Interest  Rate  Cap or Interest  Rate  Collar  on the
Variable  Rate or the Reference  Rate.

(b) 

Any conversion  requested pursuant to  paragraph  (a) of this  Section that  is
accepted  by  the  Bank  shall  be considered  a "Conversion",  as  defined  in

party,  exchange  views  on 
the  Borrower's  macroeconomic  policy
framework and the progress  achieved  in  carrying out the Program  and the
actions specified  in  Section  I of Schedule  1 to this Agreement;

2. 

If the proceeds of the  Loan have  not been fully  withdrawn  as of the  first Principal
Payment  Date, the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each Principal  Payment  Date shall be determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent  that any proceeds  of the Loan have  been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of such
withdrawal  in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule  for said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date, such  amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this Schedule,  to  which a Currency
Conversion  applies.

-11-

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan  withdrawn  within two  calendar months prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date of withdrawal  and shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that is
repayable on any Principal  Payment Date occurring during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the  Conversion by either:  (a) the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in  the Approved  Currency  payable  by the
Bank  under the  Currency Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the Conversion;  or  (b)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component  of the  Screen Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more  than one Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately to  the  amount  denominated
in each Loan Currency, so  as to  produce a separate  amortization  schedule for each
such amount.
