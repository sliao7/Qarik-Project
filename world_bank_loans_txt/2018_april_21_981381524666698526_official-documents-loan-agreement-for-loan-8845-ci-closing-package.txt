Undertakings to Satisfy the Bank Enclave Loan Requirements 

Section I. 

Guarantee Account 

1. 

2. 

Establishment. At all times from and after the Effective Date, the Borrower shall 
maintain an amount in the Guarantee Account equal to eighteen ( 18) months' peak 
anticipated debt  service payments under the Loan,  as calculated by the Bank,  it 
being  understood  that  the  debt  service  payments  shall  not  include  principal  or 
interest repayments  for  Loan amounts that are not disbursed or requested by the 
Borrower to  be  disbursed  at  such time;  provided that  for  the  last  eighteen (18) 
months  of the  term  of the  Loan,  the  amount  required  to  be  on  deposit  in  the 
Guarantee Account shall be no greater than the anticipated remaining debt service 
payments  due  under  the  Loan  at  the  time  of each  readjustment  calculated  as 
described in Section 1.2 below. For the avoidance of doubt, the Guarantee Account 
is to be opened with the Guarantee Account Bank under the Borrower's name and 
the amounts on deposit in the Guarantee Account, including interest paid by such 
Guarantee Account Bank, if any, are the property of the Borrower. 

Adjustment of Required Amounts. After the Effective Date, the amount required 
to be on deposit in the Guarantee Account may increase  or decrease during the 
term  of the  Loan,  based  upon  the  Bank's  calculation.  Every  six  (6)  months, 
concurrently with the semi-annual repayment invoices provided by the Bank to the 
Borrower, the Bank shall send a written calculation notifying the Borrower of such 
required amount. In the event that the amount on deposit in the Guarantee Account 
is  less  than  the  required  amount  at  any  six  ( 6)  month  notification,  then  the 
Borrower shall  transfer the  difference  into the  Guarantee Account  within thirty 
(30) days after the receipt thereof.  In the event that the amount on deposit in the 
Guarantee  Account  is  greater  than  the  required  amount  at  any  six  ( 6)  month 
notification,  then the Borrower may request  the Bank to  instruct  the  Guarantee 
Account Bank to transfer the surplus to the Repayment Account; and the Bank will 
provide  such instruction to  the  Guarantee  Account  Bank as  soon as  reasonably 
practicable (which shall in no event be later than thirty (30) days after the receipt 
of such instruction by the Bank) so long as,  at the time of any such transfer, the 
amount deposited in the Guarantee Account, after giving effect to  such transfer, 
shall  not  be less than the required amount  indicated  in the Bank's latest  six  (6) 
month notification. 

3. 

Replenishment.  If the  Guarantee  Account  is  ever  drawn  upon  or  otherwise 
insufficient,  then  the  Borrower  or the  Guarantor  shall  replenish  the  Guarantee 
Account as soon as practicably possible and, in any event, no later than thirty (30) 
days following the earliest of (i) the day on which the Bank instructs the Guarantee 
Account Bank to  immediately transfer funds  from  the Guarantee Account to  an 
account specified by the Bank to satisfy outstanding debt service amounts,  as set 

-26-

forth  under Section II.2  hereunder,  or (ii) the day on which the Borrower or the 
Guarantor becomes aware that the amount on deposit on the Guarantee Account is 
insufficient by notification of the  Bank in accordance with  Section 1.2  above or 
otherwise. 

Guarantee  Account  Security  Agreement.  The  Guarantee  Account  Security 
Agreement will set forth the rights and interests of the Bank and the Borrower, as 
well  as  the  responsibilities  of the  Guarantee  Account  Bank with  respect  to  the 
Guarantee  Account.  Among  other  things,  the  Guarantee  Account  Security 
Agreement will provide that (a) the Bank may unilaterally instruct the Guarantee 
Account Bank to transfer funds  from the Guarantee Account to pay overdue debt 
service  amounts  under the  Loan if the  Borrower fails  to  pay,  (b)  the  Guarantee 
Account Bank shall deliver annual account statements for the Guarantee Account 
to the Bank and the Borrower, and ( c) the Bank and the Borrower may, at any time, 
access  the  Guarantee  Account  Bank's  records  for  the  Guarantee  Account, 
including a complete history of transactions and related documents.  At all  times 
from and after the Effective Date, the Borrower shall comply with its obligations 
under the  Guarantee  Account  Security Agreement  and  not  take  any  action  that 
would limit or hinder any of the Bank's rights under such agreement. 

Final Drawdowns. The Borrower may request the Bank to instruct the Guarantee 
Account Bank to  draw  on the Guarantee Account to make the final  debt  service 
payment(s)  prior  to  final  maturity  of the  Loan,  to  the  extent  that  there  is  an 
outstanding  balance  in the Guarantee  Account  to  cover these  final  debt  service 
payment(s).  The  Bank  will  provide  such  instruction  to  the  Guarantee  Account 
Bank as soon as reasonably practicable (which shall in no event be later than thirty 
(30) days after the receipt of such instruction by the Bank), so long as, at the time 
of any such transfer, the amount deposited in the Guarantee Account, after giving 
effect to such transfer,  shall not be less than the required amount indicated in the 
Bank's latest  six  (6)  month notification.  At  the  Borrower's  request,  at  any time 
after the Loan has been repaid in full, the Bank will notify the Guarantee Account 
Bank  that  the  Bank has  no  further  interest  in  the  Guarantee  Account  and  will 
instruct the Guarantee Account Bank to pay the balance of the Guarantee Account 
into any account specified by the Borrower. 

Section II. 

Notices and Consultations in the Event of Payment Failures 

Initial  Payment  Failure.  If the  Borrower,  or  the  Guarantor  on  behalf of the 
Borrower,  fails  to  make  any payments  under the Loan when due,  then the Bank 
shall first  send a written reminder to the Borrower (with a copy to the Guarantor) 
within  five  (5)  calendar  days  after the  applicable  due  date  of the  original  debt 
service payment. The Borrower will have an additional ten (10) additional calendar 
days (the expiration of such period, which in any case shall be no less than fifteen 
(15) days  after the original due date,  the "Consultation Deadline") to consult the 
Bank,  remedy  the  elements  which  prevented  prompt  payment,  and  make  the 

4. 

5. 

1. 

-27-

2. 

3. 

payment in full of the outstanding amount.  In its reminder notice to the Borrower, 
the  Bank  shall  clearly  identify  the  Consultation  Deadline  as  well  as  the  final 
deadline date described in Section 11.3  below. The Bank will also  send a  second 
written reminder to the Borrower (with copy to the Guarantor)  if the payment in 
full  of the outstanding amount has not been made by the ninth (9th)  calendar day 
following the original due date. 

Failure to Pay by the Consultation Deadline. If the Borrower, or the Guarantor 
on behalf of the Borrower, fails to make payment in full  of any outstanding debt 
service amounts by the Consultation Deadline, then the Bank may (a)  notify the 
Borrower  and  the  Guarantor  of the  occurrence  of the  Borrower's  breach  of a 
payment  obligation,  as  described  in  Section  7.02(a)  of the  General  Conditions 
("Failure to Comply with a Payment Obligation"), and (b) instruct the Guarantee 
Account Bank to  immediately transfer funds  from  the Guarantee  Account  to  an 
account  specified by the Bank to  satisfy such outstanding debt service amounts. 
No further action or consent of the Borrower, the Guarantor or any other party shall 
be required  in order for the Bank to provide the foregoing  instruction or for the 
Guarantee Account Bank to comply with any such instruction. Once the transfer 
of  funds  to  the  Bank  has  been  completed,  the  Bank,  the  Borrower  and  the 
Guarantor will enter into discussions at the highest level to avoid any subsequent 
failures to meet a payment obligation under the Loan. 

Default.  If the  Bank  shall  have  delivered  the  written  instruction  described  in 
Section 11.2 above and nevertheless not received payment in full of all outstanding 
debt service amounts under the Loan by the date that is fifteen (15) calendar days 
after the Consultation Deadline for any reason ("Final Deadline"), then the Bank 
may declare  a  default  under  Section  7.02(a)  of the  General  Conditions.  If such 
payment is not received by the fourth ( 4th) calendar day following the Consultation 
Deadline, the Borrower, the Bank, and the Guarantor shall immediately hold high 
level discussions  in close coordination with the Guarantee Account Bank with a 
view to resolving any outstanding issues and making sure that full payment of all 
outstanding debt service amounts be received by the Bank at the latest by the Final 
Deadline. In the event an amount at least equivalent to the outstanding debt service 
amounts shows on the balance of the Guarantee Account, the Bank undertakes to 
use  its  best  efforts  when  deciding  whether  to  declare  a  default  under  Section 
7.02(a) of the General Conditions to take into account possible difficulties from a 
technical nature which are not attributable to the Borrower or the Guarantor,  and 
have  affected  the  execution  by  the  Guarantee  Account  Bank  of the  written 
instruction described in Section 11.2  above thereby preventing the payment in full 
of all outstanding debt service amounts  from taking place by the Final Deadline. 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, no  provision in this Schedule 4 shall 
be deemed to waive or limit the Bank's rights or remedies with respect to the Loan 
in accordance with the General Conditions.

ability of the Borrower to meet its periodic Loan repayment obligations from funds 
held in the Repayment Account,  including, but not  limited to,  any change in the

agree, the Borrower shall not permit the ratio of (i) the total amount that

year immediately preceding the date of any calculation to (ii) the projected 
maximum debt service requirements under the Loan for the immediately 
succeeding  calendar  year,  to  be  less  than  one  and  one-half (1.5)  (the 
"Minimum Ratio"). 

The  Bank,  on the  basis  of the  statements  of account  of the  Repayment 
Account provided monthly by the Repayment Account Bank as described 
in Section  III.2  above,  shall  calculate the Minimum Ratio  annually  and 
shall promptly notify the Borrower in the event that the Minimum Ratio is 
less than one and one-half (1.5) at any time.  Along with the semi-annual 
Bank invoice for the payment of debt service, the Bank shall also make its 
best efforts to communicate to the Borrower an intermediate projection of 
the Minimum Ratio.

Alternative Revenue Source. In the event that (a) the Minimum Ratio falls below 
one and one-half (1.5)  at  any time it  is  calculated by the Bank,  or (b)  any other 
event  occurs  that  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  result  in the  amounts  in the 
Repayment Account to be insufficient to meet the expected repayment obligations 
for the Loan, then the Borrower, the Guarantor and the Bank shall undertake high 
level  discussions  in order for  the Borrower to  identify to the  satisfaction of the 
Bank an alternative  source of revenue that  may be redirected to  the Repayment 
Account in order to satisfy the repayment obligations under the Loan. 

Withdrawals  by  Mutual  Consent.  In  addition  to  the  transfers  contemplated 
above, withdrawals may also be made from the Guarantee Account or Repayment 
Account at any time by the Bank and the Borrower acting jointly. 

Copies  to  Guarantor.  The  Bank  shall  concurrently  send  to  the  Guarantor  all 
invoices, notices, and other communications to be sent by the Bank to the Borrower 
under this  Agreement;  provided that  any  failure  to  send  such concurrent  copies
