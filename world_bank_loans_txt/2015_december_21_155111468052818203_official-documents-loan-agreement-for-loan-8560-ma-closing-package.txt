Amortization  Schedule

1. 

The following table  sets forth the  Principal  Payment  Dates of the  Loan and the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have been fully withdrawn  as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a) Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by (b)  the  Installment
Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

(a) 

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower  shall repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as
of such date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the first  Principal  Payment Date  shall  be repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling after the  date  of such withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by the Bank by  multiplying the amount  of each such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in paragraph  I  of this Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates falling  on  or  after such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted, as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months  prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on any  Principal  Payment Date,  be treated  as withdrawn  and  outstanding
on the  second  Principal  Payment  Date following  the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment Date  following the  date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the  Bank adopts  a due  date  billing system  under which  invoices are  issued on

-13-

or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I and 2  of this Schedule,  upon a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period, shall be  determined by the Bank  by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange  rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule  shall apply separately  to the amount denominated  in each  Loan
Currency,  so as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
