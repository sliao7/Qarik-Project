To the extent that any proceeds  of the Loan have been withdrawn  as of the first Principal
Payment  Date,  the Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of such  date
in accordance  with paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be repaid  on  each
Principal Payment  Date falling after the date of such  withdrawal  in amounts  determined
by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the
numerator  of which  is  the original  Installment  Share specified  in the table in paragraph
I of this  Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")  and
the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum of all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for
Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be
adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this
Schedule,  to which  a  Currency Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal
Payment Date shall,  for the purposes solely of calculating  the principal amounts  payable
on any  Principal Payment  Date, be treated  as withdrawn  and outstanding  on the second
Principal Payment  Date following  the date of withdrawal  and  shall be repayable  on each
Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at any  time
the Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under which  invoices  are  issued  on or after
the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the provisions  of such  sub-paragraph  shall  no
longer  apply to any  withdrawals  made after  the adoption  of such  billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all  or any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  to an Approved  Currency,  the
amount so converted  in the Approved Currency  that is repayable on any Principal Payment Date
occurring  during  the Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by the  Bank  by  multiplying  such
amount  in  its currency  of denomination  immediately  prior  to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i) the
exchange  rate  that reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable by  the
Bank under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so
determines  in accordance  with the  Conversion Guidelines,  the exchange  rate component  of the
