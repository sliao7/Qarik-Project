1 in 500 per year protection for large settlements and industry to about 500,000 hectares 
and  a  population  of  about  1.80  million,  through  the  financing  of  goods,  works,

Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; and by

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be

in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (“Original  Installment 
Share”)  and  the  denominator  of  which is the sum  of  all remaining  Original  Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable
