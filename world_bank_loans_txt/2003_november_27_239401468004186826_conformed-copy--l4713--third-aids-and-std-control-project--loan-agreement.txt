in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; 

(b) 

the  term  “eligible  expenditures”  means  expenditures  in  respect  of  the 
reasonable  cost  of  goods,  works  and  services  and  Incentivo/OSC  Executed  Activities

Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 

(c) 

the  term  “Authorized  Allocation”  means  the  amount  of  $10,000,000  to

paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.

2. 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule. 

After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 
3. 
has  been  duly  opened,  withdrawals  of  the  Authorized  Allocation  and  subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) 

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the  Bank  a request  or requests  for  deposit  into  the  Special  Account of an amount  or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis  of  such  request  or  requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) 

(i) 

For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall 
furnish  to  the  Bank  requests  for  deposits  into  the  Special 
Account at such intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) 

Prior to  or  at the  time  of  each  such request, the  Borrower  shall 
furnish  to  the  Bank  the  documents  and  other  evidence  required 
pursuant  to  paragraph 4  of  this  Schedule  for  the  payment  or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the

basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible  expenditures.  All  such  deposits  shall  be  withdrawn  by 
the  Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under  the  respective  eligible 
Categories,  and  in  the  respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall 
have been justified by said documents and other evidence. 

4. 
For  each  payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out  of  the  Special  Account,  the 
Borrower  shall,  at  such  time  as  the  Bank  shall  reasonably  request,  furnish  to  the  Bank 
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions of paragraph  3  of  this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall 

5. 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account: 

(a) 

if,  at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  that  all  further

accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a)

required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the 
records and accounts for the Special Account; 

(c) 

if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention 
to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the 
Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 

(d) 

 
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General  Conditions,  shall  equal  the 
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank 
shall  specify  by  notice  to  the  Borrower.    Such  further  withdrawals  shall  be  made  only 
after  and  to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that  all  such  amounts 

- 39 -

remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized 
in making payments for eligible expenditures. 

(a) 

6. 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph  2  of  this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was  not  justified  by  the  evidence  furnished  to  the 
Bank (including, for example, the documents and other evidence referred to in paragraph 
3 (d) of Schedule 1 to this Agreement), the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from 
the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit 
into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount 
equal to  the  amount  of  such  payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or justified. 
Unless the  Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the  Bank  into  the  Special 
Account  shall  be  made  until  the  Borrower  has  provided  such  evidence  or  made  such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) 

If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  amount 
outstanding  in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 
the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or 

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

(d) 

Refunds  to  the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of 
this  Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the 
General Conditions.
