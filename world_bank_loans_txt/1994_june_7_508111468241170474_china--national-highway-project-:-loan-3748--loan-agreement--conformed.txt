(a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the Henan Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Henan Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Henan Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
