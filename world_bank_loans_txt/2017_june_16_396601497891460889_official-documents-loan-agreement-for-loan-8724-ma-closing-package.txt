The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds of the Loan  have been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal  amount of the  Loan
repayable  by  the Borrower on each Principal  Payment Date shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date; by (b) the Installment Share  for each  Principal Payment Date, such
repayable  amount  to be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any amounts referred  to
in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule, to  which  a Currency  Conversion  applies.

Payment  Date, the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be  determined as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that  any proceeds  of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal in amounts  determined by the  Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date  of withdrawal and  shall  be repayable on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the  Bank adopts a due date billing system  under which  invoices
are  issued on or after the respective  Principal  Payment Date,  the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall  no longer apply to  any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption of such billing  system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any  Principal Payment  Date  occurring during  the  Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior  to the Conversion  by either: (a) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (b)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more  than one  Loan Currency,
the  provisions of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the  amount  denominated
in each  Loan  Currency,  so as to  produce a separate  amortization schedule  for each
such  amount.
