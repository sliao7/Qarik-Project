to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit 
in  the  Special  Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for 
eligible expenditures. 
 
6. 
If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the 
Special  Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible  pursuant  to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as 
the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not 
so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank 

(a) 

- 16 -

into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made 
such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

 
(b) 

 
(d) 

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in 
the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  such  outstanding 
amount. 
 
(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or  any 

portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

Refunds  to  the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of  this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
