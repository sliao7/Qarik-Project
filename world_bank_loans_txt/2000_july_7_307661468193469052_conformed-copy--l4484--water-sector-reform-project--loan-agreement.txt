6. 
If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the
Special Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible pursuant
to  paragraph  2  of  this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was  not  justified  by  the  evidence  furnished

shall  otherwise  agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the  Bank  into  the  Special Account  shall
be  made  until  the  Borrower has  provided  such evidence  or  made  such deposit  or  refund,
as  the  case  may  be.

(b) 

If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined at  any  time  that  any  amount  outstanding

in  the  Special  Account will  not  be  required to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund to  the
Bank  such  outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or  any

portion  of  the  funds  on  deposit  in  the  Special  Account.
