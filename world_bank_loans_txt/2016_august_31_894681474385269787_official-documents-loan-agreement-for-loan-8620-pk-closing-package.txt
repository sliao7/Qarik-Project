Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this  paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices 
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions 
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after 
the adoption of such billing system. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all  or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall  be determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying such amount  in  its  currency of 
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i)  the exchange rate 
that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved Currency payable by  the 
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion;  or (ii)  if 
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall  apply separately to the amount denominated 
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each 
such amount.
