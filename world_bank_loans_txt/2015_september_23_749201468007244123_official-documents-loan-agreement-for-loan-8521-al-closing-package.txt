The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment
Date ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the Loan  have been  fully  withdrawn  as  of
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by
multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be
adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts  referred to  in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,
to which a  Currency Conversion  applies.

(a) 

(b) 

To  the extent  that any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance
as  of such  date in accordance  with  paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each Principal  Payment Date falling  after the date  of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the Bank  by  multiplying  the amount of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table in  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date, such  amounts repayable  to be  adjusted, as  necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  (2)  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment Date  shall,  for  the purposes  solely of calculating  the  principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of
withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on each  Principal  Payment  Date commencing
with the second  Principal  Payment Date  following  the date of withdrawal.

-21-

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the  Bank  adopts  a due  date  billing system  under  which  invoices  are  issued
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of
such billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and 2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the  Bank by  multiplying  such  amount in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to  the Conversion by  either:  (i) the exchange  rate  that reflects  the amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the
Conversion Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is  denominated  in more than  one Loan Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount denominated  in each
Loan.
