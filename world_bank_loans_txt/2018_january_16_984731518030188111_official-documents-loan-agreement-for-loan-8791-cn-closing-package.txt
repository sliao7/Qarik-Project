Payment  Date  commencing  with  the* second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal.

Currency  Conversion of all or any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount so  converted  in the Approved  Currency  that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be determined  by the Bank  by multiplying  such  amount in  its  currency  of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either.  (i)  the exchange rate
that  reflects the  amounts  of principal  in the  Approved  Currency  payable  by the
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction  relating to the Conversion;  or (ii) if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount  denominated
in each Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a separate amortization schedule for each
such amount.
