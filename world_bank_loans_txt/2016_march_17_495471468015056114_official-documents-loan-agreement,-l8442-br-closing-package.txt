Payment Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the  Loan  have been  fully
withdrawn  as of the  first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date  shall be determined  by
the Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  and  by (b)  the  Installment  Share  for each Principal  Payment  Date,
such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred

first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn

Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1 of  this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such amounts repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary, to  deduct  any
amounts referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn  within two  calendar months prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

-25-

following the  date of withdrawal  and shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made  after
the  adoption of such billing system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all or  any  portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the  Conversion by either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component of the  Screen Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance is  denominated  in more  than one  Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated
in each Loan Currency,  so as  to produce a  separate amortization  schedule for each
such amount.
