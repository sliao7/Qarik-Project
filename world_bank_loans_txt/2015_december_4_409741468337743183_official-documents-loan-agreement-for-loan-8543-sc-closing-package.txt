the Borrower has  already  taken  under the Program  and which  are described  in  Section I  of
Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement;  and  (b)  the  Borrower's  maintenance  of  an  adequate
macroeconomic  policy  framework.  The  Borrower and the Bank therefore  hereby agree  as

The  Front-end  Fee  payable  by  the  Borrower  shall  be  equal  to  one  quarter of one
percent  (0.25%)  of the Loan  amount.

2.04.  The Commitment Charge  payable by the Borrower  shall be equal  to one quarter  of

to  a  Fixed  Rate  for  the  full  maturity  of  such  amount  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of  Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions  and  of  the  Conversion
Guidelines.

2.10  Without  limitation  upon  the provisions of Section  5.08  of the General  Conditions

SCHEDULE  2

Amortization  Schedule

1. 

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal  Payment Date,  the principal  amount  of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each Principal  Payment Date shall  be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  by (b) the Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount to  be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any amounts  referred  to
in  paragraph 4  of this Schedule,  to which  a Currency  Conversion  applies.

Principal Payment  Date 

(Expressed  as a  Percentage)

Installment Share

On  each February  15  and August  15 

3.33%

beginning February  15,  2028,

through  February  15,  2042

On  August  15,  2042 

3.43%

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Loan have  not been  fully  withdrawn  as  of the first Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment Date shall  be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

to the extent that any  proceeds  of the Loan  have been  withdrawn  as  of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of this
Schedule;  and

any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts determined  by the Bank  by  multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct any
amounts  referred to  in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

-10-

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan withdrawn  within  two  calendar months  prior  to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment Date,  be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and shall  be  repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any  time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment  Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion by either: (a)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to the  Conversion;  or  (b)  if
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
the  Bank  so  determines 
exchange  rate component  of the Screen Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance is  denominated  in  more than  one Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall apply  separately  to  the amount  denominated
in  each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each
such amount.
