period;  (ii)  financial  position;  and  where  relevant  (iii)  capability  of  construction
and/or manufacturing  facilities.

Prequalification  procedures  and documents  satisfactory  to the  Bank  shall  be  used
for  large,  complex  and/or  specialized  works  contracts.  Verification  of  the
information upon which a bidder was prequalified,  including current commitments
and  the  bidder's  capability  with  respect  to  personnel  and  equipment,  shall  be
carried  out at the time  of contract award.

Where  prequalification 
is  not  used,  the  qualification  of  the  bidder  who  is
recommended  for  award  of  contract  shall  be  assessed  by  post-qualification,
applying the  qualification  criteria stated  in the bidding documents.

Bid  Evaluation:  Evaluation  criteria  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the  bidding
documents.  Evaluation of bids shall  be made in strict adherence to the quantifiable
criteria  declared  in  the  bidding  documents.  Evaluation  criteria  other  than  price
shall  be  quantified  in  monetary  terms.  Merit  points  and  bracketing  shall  not  be
used,  and  no  minimum  point  or  percentage  value  shall  be  assigned  to  the
significance  of price, in bid evaluation.  Bidders  shall not be eliminated on the basis
of  minor,  nonmaterial  deviations.  The  procuring  entity  shall  ask  bidders  for
clarifications  needed to  evaluate  their bids,  but  shall not  ask or permit bidders  to
change  the  substance  or price  of their  bids after  the bid opening.

Contracts shall  be  awarded to the  qualified bidder whose  bid has  been determined:
(i)  to  be  substantially  responsive  to  the  bidding  documents;  and  (ii)  to  offer  the
lowest-evaluated  cost.  No negotiation  as  to the price  or substance  of the bid  shall
take place.

Rejection  of Bids  and Re-Bidding:  No bids  shall  be rejected  solely  because  they
fall  below  or exceed  the estimated  cost  or  outside  of a  range  or "bracket"  of bid
values.  All  bids  (including  in the case  when  less  than  two  bids  are  received)  shall
not be  rejected,  the procurement process shall  not be cancelled,  and new bids  shall
not be  solicited  without  the Bank's  prior written  concurrence.

Guarantees:  Bid  and  contract  guarantees  shall  be  in  the  format  and  have  the
required  period  of  validity  specified  in  the  bidding  documents.  If  required,  bid
security  shall  be  expressed  as  a  fixed  amount  and  shall  not  exceed  two  percent
(2%)  of the estimated cost of the contract.  No advance payments  shall  be  made  to
contractors  without  a suitable  advance  payment guarantee.

Confidentiality:  The  process  of  bid  evaluation  shall  be  confidential  until  the
publication  of contract award.

Electronic  Procurement  Systems:  Electronic  procurement  systems  may  be  used,
provided  that  the  Bank  is  satisfied  with  the  adequacy  of  the  systems,  including
inter  alia,  that  the  system  is  secure,  maintains  the  integrity,  confidentiality,  and
authenticity  of bids  submitted.

Fraud  and  Corruption: 
In  accordance  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines,  each
bidding  document  and  contract  shall  include  provisions  stating the  Bank's  policy
to sanction  firms  or individuals,  found to have  engaged  in  fraud and/or  corruption
as  defined  in the Procurement  Guidelines.

Inspection  and Audit Rights:  In accordance  with the Procurement  Guidelines,  each
bidding  document  and  contract  financed  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall
provide  that  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors  and  their  subcontractors,  agents,
personnel,  consultants,  service  providers,  or  suppliers  shall  permit  the  Bank  to
inspect  all  accounts,  records  and  other  documents  relating  to  the bid  submission
and performance  of the contract and  to have  said  accounts  and records  audited  by
auditors  appointed by  the Bank.  Acts  intended  to  materially  impede  the exercise
of  the  Bank's  inspection  and  audit  rights  provided  for  in  the  Procurement
Guidelines  constitute  an obstructive  practice  as defined  in the  Guidelines.

Publication  of  the  Award  of  Contract:  The  procuring  entity  shall  publish  the
following  information  on  contract  award  in  a  free  and  open  access  website  or  on
another  means  of publication  acceptable  to the Bank:  (a)  name of each  bidder who
submitted a bid;  (b) bid prices as  read out at  bid opening;  (c)  name and  evaluated
price  of each  bid that was evaluated;  (d)  name  of bidders  whose  bids were rejected
and  the reasons  for  their  rejection;  and  (e)  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  price  it
offered  as  well  as the duration  and summary  scope of the  contract  awarded.

SCHEDULE  3

Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  ("Installment Share").  If the proceeds  of the  Loan have  been fully
withdrawn as  of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of  the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  by  (b) the Installment  Share  for each Principal  Payment Date,  such
repayable  amount  to  be adjusted, as  necessary,  to  deduct any  amounts  referred  to
in paragraph 4  of this Schedule,  to which a Currency  Conversion  applies.

If the proceeds  of the  Loan  have  not been fully  withdrawn  as of the  first Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal Payment Date  shall  be  determined as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan  have been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of  such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined by the Bank by multiplying  the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred to  in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

-16-

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within two calendar months  prior  to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and shall  be  repayable on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions of sub-paragraph  (a) of this paragraph,  if
at any time  the Bank adopts a due date billing  system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption of such billing  system.

4. 

5. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion  by either:  (i) the  exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than one  Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the  amount  denominated
in  each Loan  Currency,  so as  to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
