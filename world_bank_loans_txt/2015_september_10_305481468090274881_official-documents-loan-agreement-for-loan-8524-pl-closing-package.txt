of the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have been  fully withdrawn  as  of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
(a)
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment
Share  for each Principal  Payment  Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as  necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency

2. 

If the  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  not been fully  withdrawn  as of the first  Principal  Payment

(b) 

3. 

(a) 

To  the  extent that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the Borrower shall  repay  the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as
of such date  in  accordance  with paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling after the  date of such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date, such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any  amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

Amounts of the Loan  withdrawn  within  two calendar  months  prior to any  Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as withdrawn  and  outstanding
on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following the  date  of withdrawal  and shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment Date  following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the  Bank  adopts a  due date  billing  system  under  which  invoices are  issued  on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-

-17-

paragraph  shall  no longer apply to any  withdrawals  made after the adoption  of such
billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all  or any portion of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring  during  the Conversion  Period, shall be  determined  by the Bank  by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule  shall apply  separately  to the amount  denominated  in  each  Loan
Currency,  so  as to  produce  a  separate amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
