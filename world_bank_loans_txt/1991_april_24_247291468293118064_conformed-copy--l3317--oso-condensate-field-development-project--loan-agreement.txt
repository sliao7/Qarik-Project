                    Description of the Project

     The main objective of the Project is to assist in the commer-
cial development of the  Oso  Condensate Field located offshore in
the Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria (the Oso Field) for an initial peak
production of 100 thousand barrels of condensate per day.

     The Project consists of the  following Parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Bank  and the Borrower may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:

Part A:   Offshore Surface Facilities

     Offshore surface facilities consisting of:

     (a)  four wellhead production platforms, each equipped with a
9-well jacket, located over the field  from which 19 wells will be
directionally drilled to predetermined areas of the reservoir; and

     (b)  a central facilities  complex  consisting of three plat-
forms, interconnected with bridges for  ease of access and safety,
including: (i)  one  production  platform  equipped  with a single
cascading train of separators  designed  to process the entire Oso
Field  production;  (ii)  one  gas  compression/injection platform
equipped with compressor trains designed  for a through-put of 500
million standard cubic  feet  of  gas  per  day  in five stages of
compression;  (iii)  one  accommodation/utility  platform equipped
with: (A) installations necessary to  house, feed and cater to the
needs  of  60  personnel;  (B)  a  helicopter  deck;  (C)  a power
generation station  rated  at  5.4  MW;  and  (D) a communications
network, air conditioning  system,  and  a  waste disposal system;
(iv) one riser platform  for  all incoming and outgoing pipelines;
(v) one flare stack for burning and discharging gas; (vi) about 54

miles  of  underwater  low  pressure  flowlines  for  transporting
associated gas produced in neighboring oil production platforms to
Oso; (vii) approximately 10 miles  of high pressure production and
injection flowlines; and (viii) approximately 32 miles of pipeline
for transferring the stabilized condensate for storage onshore.

Part B:   Onshore Facilities

(1)  Three  670,000  barrel  tanks,  each  equipped  with floating
roofs, and  a  cumulative  storage  capacity  of  about  2 million
barrels of condensate.

(2)  Metering facilities, equipped with  turbine meters and prover
loops to measure the condensate as it is pumped for export.

(3)  Loading pumps  designed  to  deliver  condensate from storage
tanks to the tankers.

(4)  A 36 inch  underwater  product  loading  line, about 22 miles
long to a single point mooring.

(5)  A single point mooring buoy anchored some 30 miles off-shore,
with oil discharge facilities and  hoses required to load tankers.

(6)  Control room  and  panels  to  be  incorporated into existing
facilities at the Qua Iboe Oil terminal.

Part C:   Development Drilling Program

     Drilling of 19 wells  for  production and injection from four
well head jacket platforms each  provided  with slots for a 9-well
jacket.

                            *    *    *

     The Project is expected to be  completed by June 30, 1993 and
will be deemed to be  completed  when: (i) the facilities included
in Parts A  and  B  of  the  Project  have  been (A) commissioned,
inspected, certified and  accepted  by  the operator in accordance
with sound engineering procedures and practices in common usage in
the international petroleum industry, and (B) put into usage for a
consistent period  of  90  days;  and  (ii)  the  production wells
included in Part  C  of  the  Project  have  been (A) bottomed and
tested in  accordance  with  said  procedures  and  practices, and
(B) put on production for a consistent period of 90 days.

                            SCHEDULE 5

                          Special Account

1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:

     (a)  the term "eligible Categories"  means Categories (1) and
(2) set forth in the table  in  paragraph  1 of Schedule 1 to this
Agreement;

     (b)  the term "eligible  expenditures"  means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost  of goods and services required for
the Project and to be  financed  out  of  the proceeds of the Loan
allocated from time to time  to the eligible Categories in accord-
ance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

     (c)  the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equiva-
lent to $15,000,000  to  be  withdrawn  from  the Loan Account and
deposited into the Special Account  pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of
this Schedule.

2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures  in  accordance  with  the provisions of
this Schedule.

3.   After the Bank has received  evidence satisfactory to it that

the Special  Account  has  been  duly  opened,  withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent  withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:

     (a)  For  withdrawals  of   the  Authorized  Allocation,  the
Borrower shall furnish to  the  Bank  a  request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which  do  not  exceed the aggregate amount of
the  Authorized  Allocation.  On  the  basis  of  such  request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from
the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or
amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

     (b)   (i)  For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account, the
                Borrower shall furnish  to  the  Bank requests for
                deposits  into   the   Special   Account  at  such
                intervals as the Bank shall specify.

         (ii)  Prior to or at the  time  of each such request, the
               Borrower shall furnish  to  the  Bank the documents
               and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4
               of this Schedule  for  the  payment  or payments in
               respect of which  replenishment  is  requested.  On
               the basis of each such  request, the Bank shall, on
               behalf of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the Loan
               Account and deposit  into  the Special Account such
               amount as the Borrower  shall have requested and as
               shall have been shown  by  said documents and other
               evidence to  have  been  paid  out  of  the Special
               Account for eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall  be  withdrawn  by  the Bank from the Loan
Account under  the  respective  eligible  Categories,  and  in the
respective equivalent amounts,  as  shall  have  been justified by
said documents and other evidence.

4.   For each payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at  such  time as the Bank shall rea-
sonably request, furnish  to  the  Bank  such  documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligi-
ble expenditures.

5.   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph  3  of  this
Schedule, the Bank shall not  be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:

     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be  made  by the Borrower directly from
the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of
the General Conditions and paragraph  (a)  of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or

     (b)  once the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible  Categories  less  the  amount  of any outstanding
special commitment entered into  by  the  Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions  with respect to the Project, shall
equal  the  equivalent  of  twice  the  amount  of  the Authorized
Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the  Loan  allocated to the eligible Catego-
ries shall follow such  procedures  as  the  Bank shall specify by
notice to the  Borrower.  Such  further  withdrawals shall be made
only after and to the extent  that the Bank shall have been satis-
fied that all such  amounts  remaining  on  deposit in the Special
Account as of the date of  such  notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
payment out of the Special  Account:  (i) was made for an expendi-
ture or in an amount not  eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not  justified  by the evidence furnished to
the Bank, the Borrower shall,  promptly upon notice from the Bank:

(A) provide such additional evidence  as  the Bank may request; or
(B) deposit into the  Special  Account  (or,  if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such
payment or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible or justified.
Unless the Bank shall otherwise  agree,  no further deposit by the
Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has
provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special  Account will not be required to
cover further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion  of  the  funds  on deposit in the Special
Account.

     (d)  Refunds to the Bank  made  pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or  for  cancellation in accordance with
the relevant provisions of  this  Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
