objectives:

Part A:

Capital Restructuring

Capital restructuring of PBs so as to achieve capital adequacy norms established

strength and long-term competitiveness in a more liberalized business and banking 
environment consisting, inter alia, of:

development plans; 

(ii)

Automation and Computerization: Automation and computerization of payment 

and accounting systems to improve customer service; internal controls; 
decision-making; and productivity and profitability, including by fully automating 
selected branches, computerizing functions such as credit management, strengthening

asset-liability management and management information systems; establishing electronic 
communication capabilities within each PB and with outside entities; installing 
automatic teller machines where warranted by market conditions; and providing computer

PBs in the light of emerging business priorities and their strategic plans, to

eliminate excess costs, improve customer services; and rationalize chronic, 
loss-making branches; and open new branches for specialized functions such as export 
credit and leasing;

(v)

Asset-Liability and Treasury Management: Strengthening asset-liability 

and treasury management to control overall balance sheet risk and liquidity 
volatility, inter alia, by establishing automated management information systems (MIS) 
for asset-liability management with capacity to gather all relevant data on loans, 
deposits, liquidity positions, margins, maturity gaps, and interest rate gaps; and 
evaluating use of certificates of deposits (CDs), inter-bank funds and similar 
instruments to manage liability positions and improve foreign exchange management 
capabilities; and

(vi)

Credit Management: Strengthening evaluation of credit risk, in particular 

to enhance incorporation of environmental impact assessment in the loan appraisal 
processes; pricing credit in relation to risk; streamlining loan documentation and 
approval procedures; improving identification of risk concentrations and opportunities 
at the sectoral level; preparation of credit aspects of strategic plans; formulation 
of credit policies; and development of financial products.

Part C:

of the foreign currency lending market in India by offering them an  option to borrow 
funds, under stipulated conditions, during financial market disruption, for the 
financing of specific development projects through Sub-loans to Investment

SCHEDULE 5

Single Currency LIBOR Determination

Single Currency LIBOR for any Interest Period shall be the offered rate for 

1.
deposits in dollars for a period of six months which appears on the display designated 
as page "3750" on the Telerate monitor (or such other page or service as may replace 
it for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks for 
dollar deposits), as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second day on which banks and 
foreign exchange markets are open for business in London prior to the relevant January 
15 or July 15 (the Interest Determination Date).

2.
If such rate does not appear on the Telerate monitor or on such service as may 
replace it, the Bank shall request the London offices of four major banks to provide 
the Bank with the rate at which deposits in dollar are offered by such banks on the 
Interest Determination Date to leading banks in the London interbank market for a 
period of six months ending on the last day of such Interest Period. Single Currency 
LIBOR for such Interest Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if 
necessary to the fifth decimal place) of such offered quotations as determined by the 
Bank.

If not more than one major bank provides the Bank with such quotations under 

3.
paragraph 2 above, Single Currency LIBOR shall be arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if 
necessary to the fifth decimal place) determined by the Bank of the rates quoted by at 
least two major banks in New York selected by the Bank on the Interest Determination 
Date for loans in dollar to leading European banks for a period of six months ending 
on the last day of such Interest Period. If fewer than two of the banks so selected 
are quoting such rates, Single Currency LIBOR shall be the single currency in effect 
for the last preceding Interest Period.
