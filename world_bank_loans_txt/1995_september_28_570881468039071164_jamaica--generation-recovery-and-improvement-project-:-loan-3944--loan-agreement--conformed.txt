5.  Whenever,  in  light of changes  in market  practice  affecting  the determination  of the
interest  rates referred  to in  this  Schedule,  the  Bank determines  that  it is  in the  interest of
its  borrowers  as  a  whole  and  of the Bank  to  apply  a  basis  for  determining  the  interest
rates  applicable to the Loan  other than  as provided  in this Schedule,  the Bank may modify
the  basis  for  determining  the  interest  rates  applicable  to  amounts  of the  Loan  not  yet
withdrawn  upon  not  less than  six  (6)  months'  notice  to the  Borrower  of the  new  basis.
The  new  basis  shall  become  effective  on  the  expiry  of  the  notice  period  unless  the

modification  shall  not  apply to  the  Loan.

(c) 

the  term  "Authorized  Allocation"  means  an  amount  equivalent  to  $500,000
to  be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  in  the  Special  Account  pursuant
to  paragraph  3  (a)  of  this  Schedule,  provided,  however,  that  unless  the  Bank  shall
otherwise  agree,  the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited  to  an  amount  equivalent  to
$250,000  until the aggregate  amount of withdrawals  from  the  Loan Account plus the  total
amount  of all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to
Section  5.02  of the  General  Conditions  shall  be  equal  to  or  exceed  the  equivalent  of

Payments  out  of  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  exclusively  for  eligible

2. 
expenditures  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of this  Schedule.

3.  After the Bank has  received  evidence  satisfactory  to  it  that  the Special  Account  has
been  duly opened,  withdrawals  of the Authorized  Allocation  and  subsequent withdrawals
to replenish  the  Special  Account  shall be  made  as  follows:

(a) 

For withdrawals  of the Authorized  Allocation,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to
the Bank a request or requests  for a deposit or deposits which  do not exceed  the aggregate
amount  of the Authorized  Allocation.  On  the basis  of such  request  or requests,  the Bank
shall,  on  behalf  of the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  in  the
Special  Account  such amount  or  amounts  as the  Borrower  shall have  requested.

(b) 

(i) 

For  replenishment  of the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall

furnish  to  the Bank  the  documents  and other  evidence  required
pursuant  to  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule  for  the  payment  or
payments  in respect of which replenishment  is requested.  On  the
basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the
Borrower,  withdraw from  the Loan  Account and deposit into the
Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have
requested  and  as  shall have  been  shown by  said documents  and
other  evidence  to have been  paid out of the  Special Account  for
eligible  expenditures.

All  such  deposits  shall  be  withdrawn  by  the  Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under  the
respective eligible Categories,  and in the respective equivalent amounts,  as shall have been
justified  by said documents  and other  evidence.

For each  payment  made by the  Borrower  out of the Special  Account,  the Borrower

5.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraph  3 of this Schedule, the  Bank shall  not
be  required  to  make  further  deposits  into  the  Special  Account:

(a) 

if, at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  that all  further  withdrawais
should  be made  by the  Borrower  directly  from  the  Loan Account  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of Article  V  of the  General  Conditions and  paragraph  (a)  of Section  2.02  of
this Agreement;  or

(b) 

if the Borrower  shall  have  failed  to  furnish  to the  Bank, within the period  of
time specified in  Section 4.01  (b) (ii)  of this Agreement,  any of the audit  reports  required
to be  furnished  to the Bank pursuant to said  Section in respect  of the  audit of the records
and  accounts  for the  Special  Account;

(c) 

if, at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have notified  the Borrower  of its  intention to
suspend  in whole  or in part the right of the Borrower to make  withdrawals from  the Loan
Account  pursuant to the  provisions  of Section  6.02  of the General  Conditions;  or

(d) 

once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible
Categories,  less  the amount  of any  outstanding  special  commitment  entered  into  by  the
Bank pursuant  to Section  5.02  of the General Conditions  with respect to the Project,  shall
equal  the  equivalent  of twice  the amount  of the  Authorized  Allocation.

- 19  -

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the Loan  Account of the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount of
the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further  withdrawals shall be made only after
and  to the extent that the  Bank shall  have been  satisfied that all  such amounts remaining
on  deposit in the  Special  Account as of the date  of such notice will  be utilized  in  making
payments  for  eligible  expenditures.

(a) 

If the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that any  payment  out of the
6. 
Special  Account:  (i) was  made for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not eligible  pursuant
to paragraph  2  of this  Schedule;  or (ii)  was not justified  by the evidence  furnished  to the
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such
additional  evidence  as the Bank may request;  or (B)  deposit into the Special Account (or,
if the Bank  shall  so request, refund  to the  Bank) an  amount  equal to the amount  of such
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree,  no  further  deposit  by  the Bank  into  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  until  the
Borrower  has  provided  such  evidence  or made  such  deposit  or refund,  as  the  case may
be.

(b) 

If the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time that  any amount  outstanding
in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible
expenditures, the Borrower  shall, promptly upon notice from  the Bank, refund to the Bank
such outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice to  the  Bank,  refund  to the  Bank  all  or any

portion  of the funds  on  deposit  in the  Special  Account.

(d)  Refunds  to the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of this
Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with the  relevant  provisions  of this Agreement,  including  the
General  Conditions.
