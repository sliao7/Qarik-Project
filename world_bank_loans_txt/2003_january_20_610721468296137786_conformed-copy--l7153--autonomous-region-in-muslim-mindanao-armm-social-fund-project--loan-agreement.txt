Amortization Schedule 

1. 
The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 
the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 
Date,  such  repayment  amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  not  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) 

Any  withdrawal  made  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such  withdrawal  in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original 
Installment  Share)  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

- 19 - 

(a) 

3. 
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if  at  any  time  the  Bank  shall adopt  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which invoices  are 
issued  on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of  such 
billing system.  

4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period, 
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate. 

If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
5. 
shall  be  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule 
shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) 

the term “eligible Categories” means Categories 1 through 5 as set forth

(b) 

the  term  “eligible  expenditures”  means  expenditures  in  respect  of  the 
reasonable cost of goods, works and services required for the Project and to be financed 
out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 

(c) 

the term “Authorized Allocation” means the amount of $2,300,000 to be 
withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the  Special  Account  pursuant  to 
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise 
agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to the amount of $1,000,000 until the 
aggregate  amount  of  withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  plus  the  total  amount  of  all 
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the 
General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of $10,000,000. 

Payments  out  of  the  Special  Account  shall  be  made  exclusively  for  eligible 

2. 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule. 

3. 
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account

withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) 

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the  Bank  a request  or requests  for  deposit  into  the  Special  Account of an amount  or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis  of  such  request  or  requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) 

(i) 

For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall

Account at such intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

- 33 -

Prior to  or  at the  time  of  each  such request, the  Borrower  shall 
furnish  to  the  Bank  the  documents  and  other  evidence  required

Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the  Special Account for 
eligible  expenditures.  All  such  deposits  shall  be  withdrawn  by 
the  Bank  from  the  Loan  Account  under  the  respective  eligible 
Categories,  and  in  the  respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall 
have been justified by said documents and other evidence.

accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) 
of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the

if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention 
to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the

(d) 

once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General  Conditions,  shall  equal  the 
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

- 34 - 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank 
shall  specify  by  notice  to  the  Borrower.    Such  further  withdrawals  shall  be  made  only

remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized 
in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6. 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph  2  of  this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was  not  justified  by  the  evidence  furnished  to  the 
Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, 
if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such 
payment  or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible  or  justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made 
until  the  Borrower  has  provided  such  evidence  or  made  such  deposit  or  refund,  as  the 
case may be. 

(b) 

If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  amount 
outstanding  in  the  Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 
the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) 

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or 

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

(d) 

Refunds  to  the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of 
this  Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the 
General Conditions.
