withdrawn  as of the  first  Principal  Payment Date, the principal  amount of the  Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying-  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment  Date,  such

first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  failing  after  the  date  of  such

of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment Date (-Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original

Amounts of the  Loan  withdrawn  within two calendar months  prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the

Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal.

of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any  withdrawals made after
the adoption of such  billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion of all  or any  portion  of  the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable on  any Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the Conversion  by  either- (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the Currency  Hedge Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in  more  than one  Loan  Currency.
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall apply separately  to  the amount  denominated
in each  Loan  Currency,  so as  to produce a  separate amortization  schedule for each
such  amount.
