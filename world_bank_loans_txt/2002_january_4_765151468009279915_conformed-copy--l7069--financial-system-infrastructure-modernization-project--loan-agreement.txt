SCHEDULE 4

Special Account

1.

For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a)

the term “eligible Categories” means Categories (1), (2) and (3) set forth in the 

table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

(b)

the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the reasonable 
cost of goods and services required for  the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the 
Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c)

the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount equivalent to $5,000,000 to 
be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the  Special  Account  pursuant  to 
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, 
the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited  to  an  amount  equivalent  to  $3,000,000  until  the 
aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding 
special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General 

Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of $30,000,000. 

Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures 

2.
in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been 
duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish 
the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a)

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which 
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and 
deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b)

(i)

For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account at such intervals 
as the Bank shall specify.

(ii)

Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the  Bank  the  documents  and  other  evidence  required  pursuant  to 
para-graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of 
which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 
have  requested  and  as  shall  have  been  shown  by  said  documents  and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for eligible 
expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the 
Loan  Account  under  the  respective  eligible  Categories,  and  in  the 
respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall  have  been  justified  by  said 
documents and other evidence.

For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower shall, 
4.
at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  3  of  this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall  not  be 

5.
required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a)

if,  at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  that  all  further  withdrawals 
should  be  made  by  the  Borrower  directly  from  the  Loan  Account  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions  of  Article  V  of  the  General  Conditions  and  paragraph  (a)  of  Section  2.02  of  this 
Agreement;

(b)

if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period of time 

specified  in  Section  4.01  (b)  (ii)  of  this  Agreement,  any  of  the  audit  reports  required  to  be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts 
for the Special Account;

(c)

if,  at  any  time,  the  Bank  shall  have  notified  the  Borrower  of  its  intention  to 
suspend  in  whole  or  in  part  the  right  of  the  Borrower  to  make  withdrawals  from  the  Loan 
Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

(d)

once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible 
Categories,  minus  the  total  amount  of  all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  into  by  the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of  the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the 
Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify 
by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent 
that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special 
Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  eligible 
expenditures.

(a)

6.
If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the 
Special  Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible  pursuant  to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the 
Bank  may  request;  or  (B)  deposit  into  the  Special  Account  (or,  if  the  Bank  shall  so  request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so 
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into 
the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b)

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  such  outstanding 
amount.

(c)

The  Borrower  may,  upon  notice  to  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  all  or  any 

portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d)

Refunds  to  the  Bank  made  pursuant  to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of  this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
