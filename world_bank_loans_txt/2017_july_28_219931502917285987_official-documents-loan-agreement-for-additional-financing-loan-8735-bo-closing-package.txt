If the proceeds  of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn  as of the first Principal Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment Date shall be determined  as follows:

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any proceeds  of the Loan  have  been withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal Payment  Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as
of such date in  accordance  with paragraph  1 of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the first  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be repaid  on
each  Principal Payment  Date falling  after the  date of such withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by the Bank by multiplying  the amount  of each  such withdrawal  by a
fraction, the  numerator  of which is  the original  Installment  Share  specified  in the
table in  paragraph  1 of this  Schedule  for said Principal  Payment  Date ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or after  such
date,  such amounts repayable  to be adjusted,  as necessary, to  deduct any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the  Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely of calculating  the principal  amounts
payable  on any Principal  Payment  Date, be  treated as withdrawn  and outstanding
on the  second  Principal  Payment Date  following the date  of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment Date following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2 of this  Schedule,  upon a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved  Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,  shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by the Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating

-20-

to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange rate  component  of the Screen Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this Schedule shall apply  separately to the amount  denominated in each Loan
Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each such  amount.
