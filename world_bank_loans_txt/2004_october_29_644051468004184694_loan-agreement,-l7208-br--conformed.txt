if the Borrower is making Report-based Disbursements, withdrawals shall

4. 
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

if the Bank at any time is not satisfied that the reports referred to in 
Part  A.5  of  this  Schedule  1  adequately  provide  the  information  required  for 
Report-based Disbursements; 

(b) 

if the Bank determines at any time that all further withdrawals for payment

expenditure, as the case may be. 

5. 
The Bank shall not be required to  make  further  deposits  into  the  Special 
Account in accordance with the provisions of Part B.2 of this Schedule if, at any 
time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower and the Guarantor of its intention 
to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from 
the Loan Account pursuant to Section 6.02 of the General Conditions.  Upon such 

20-

-

notification,  the  Bank  shall  determine,  in  its  sole  discretion,  whether  further 
deposits  into  the  Special  Account  may  be  made  and  what  procedures  should  be

Expenditure,  or  was  not  justified  by  the  evidence  furnished  to  the  Bank,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  provide  such  additional 
evidence as the Bank may request, or deposit into the Special Account (or, if the 
Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such

of  this  paragraph  6  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent 
withdrawal  or  for  cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan 
Agreement.

1. 
amount  of  $5,000,000  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposited  into  the 
Special Account pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Annex, provided, however, that unless the 
Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  the  Authorized  Allocation  shall  be  limited  to  the  amount  of 
$2,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total 
amount  of  all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to 
Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed $15,000,000. 

Withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to 

2. 
replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:  

(a) 

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall 
 
furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of 
an  amount  or  amounts  which  in  the  aggregate  do  not  exceed  the  Authorized 
Allocation.    On  the  basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account 
such amount as the Borrower shall have requested.  

(b) 

For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall 
 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposit into the Special Account at such intervals 
as  the  Bank  shall  specify.    Prior  to  or  at  the  time  of  each  such  request,  the 
Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the  Bank  the  documents  and  other  evidence  required 
pursuant to Part B.3 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement for the payment or payments 
in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and 
deposit  into  the  Special  Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and other evidence to 
have been paid  out  of the Special Account for  Eligible  Expenditures.  Each such 
deposit into the Special Account shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan 
Account under one or more of the Eligible Categories. 

3. 
The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account, 
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan minus the total amount of all outstanding 

22-

-

special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General 
Conditions shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the  Loan  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank  shall  specify  by  notice  to  the 
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special 
Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  Eligible 
Expenditures.

this Schedule 1 applicable to such withdrawal application, is required to be deposited in 
order to finance Eligible Expenditures during the six-month  period following the date of 
such reports. 

3.

once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan minus the total amount of all outstanding 
special  commitments  entered  into  by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of  the  General 
Conditions shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the  Loan  shall  follow  such  procedures  as  the  Bank  shall  specify  by  notice  to  the 
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the

table  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  (the  Original 
Installment  Share)  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(a) 

3. 
Withdrawals  made  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if  at  any  time  the  Bank  shall adopt  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which invoices  are 
issued  on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of  such 
billing system. 

4. 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period, 
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  said  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate. 

5. 
If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall  be  denominated  in  more than  one  Loan  Currency,  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule 
shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as  to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
