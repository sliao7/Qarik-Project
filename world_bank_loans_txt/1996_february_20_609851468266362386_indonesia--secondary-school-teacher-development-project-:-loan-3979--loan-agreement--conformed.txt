Categories  minus the total  amount  of all  outstanding  special  commitments  entered  into
by  the  Bank  pursuant  to  Section  5.02  of the  General  Conditions  with  respect  to  the

after  and  to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that  all  such  amounts
remaining  on deposit in the Special Account  as of the date of such notice will  be utilized
in making payments  for eligible expenditures.

(a) 

If the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any time  that  any payment  out  of
6. 
the  Special  Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an  expenditure  or  in  an  amount  not  eligible
pursuant  to  paragraph  2  of  this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was  not justified  by  the  evidence
furnished  to  the  Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)
provide  such  additional  evidence  as  the  Bank  may  request;  or  (B)  deposit  into  the
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount  equal to
the  amount of such payment  or the portion thereof not so  eligible or justified. Unless the
Bank shall  otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special  Account shall
be  made until the  Borrower has  provided  such evidence  or made  such  deposit or refund,
as the case may be.

(b) 

If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  amount
outstanding  in  the  Special  Account will  not be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for
eligible expenditures,  the Borrower shall,  promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund  to
the Bank such outstanding  amount.

(c) 

The  Borrower  may, upon  notice  to the  Bank,  refund  to the  Bank  all  or

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

Refunds  to the Bank  made  pursuant to  paragraphs  6  (a),  (b)  and  (c)  of
this  Schedule  shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for
cancellation  in  accordance  with the  relevant provisions  of this Agreement,  including the
