paragraphs  2  and  4  below,  goods  and  works  shall  be  procured  under  contracts 
awarded  on  the  basis  of  International  Competitive  Bidding.  The  provisions  of 
paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Procurement Guidelines and Appendix 2 thereto 
shall  apply  to  goods  manufactured  in  the  territory  of  the  Borrower  (other  than 
goods  manufactured  in  the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  of  the 
Borrower  or the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Borrower).

that  are  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $100,000  equivalent  but  less  than 
$2,000,000 equivalent each or goods contracts that are estimated to cost 
less  than  $300,000  equivalent  each,  which  may  be  advertised  in  a

All  bidders  that  meet  the  qualification  criteria  set  out  in  the  pre-

All bidders shall be required to provide security in an amount sufficient 
to  protect the  employer  in case  of  breach of  contract by  the  contractor, 
and the bidding documents shall specify the required form and amount of 
such  security.  In  place  of  a  bid  security,  the  bidding  documents  may 
require that a bidder submit with its bid a signed declaration that, if the 
bidder withdraws its bid during the bid validity period or, if awarded the 
contract,  the  bidder  fails  to  sign  the  contract  or  submit  any  required 
performance  security  before  the  deadline  required  in  the  bidding 
documents,  the  bidder  will  be  suspended  for  a  period  of  two  (2)  years

Implementing  Entity  (Anhui),  including  any  of  their  departments, 
agencies or administrative units.

bids.

and  quantified  in  monetary  terms  or  expressed  in  the  form  of  pass/fail 
requirements. 

 
(viii)  No bid may be rejected solely on the basis that the bid price falls outside 
any  standard  contract  estimate,  or  margin  or  bracket  of  average  bids 
established by the Borrower or Project Implementing Entity (Anhui). 

Each  contract  shall  be  awarded  to  the  lowest  evaluated  responsive 
bidder,  that  is,  the  bidder  who  meets  the  appropriate  standards  of 
capability  and  resources  and  whose  bid  has  been  determined:  (A) to  be

lowest  evaluated  cost.  The  winning  bidder  shall  not  be  required,  as  a 
condition of award, to undertake responsibilities for work not stipulated 
in  the  bidding  documents  or  otherwise  to  modify  the  bid  as  originally 
submitted. 
 
Each contract financed with the proceeds of the Loan shall provide that 
the  suppliers  and  contractors  shall  permit  the  Bank,  at  its  request,  to 
inspect  their  accounts  and  records  relating  to  the  performance  of  the 
contract  and  to  have  said  accounts  and  records  audited  by  auditors 
appointed by the Bank. 
 
Government  owned  enterprises  in  the  Borrower’s  territory  may  be 
permitted to bid or submit a proposal for goods if they can establish that 
they:  (A)  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous;  (B)  operate  under 
commercial  law;  and  (C)  are  not  a  dependent  agency  of  the  agency 
conducting the procurement. 
 

(x) 

(xi) 

(xii)  Re-bidding  should  not  be allowed solely  because the  number  of  bids  is 
less  than  three  (3),  and  rejection  of  all  bids  or  rebidding  shall  not  take 
place without the Bank’s prior written concurrence. 
 

(xiii)  The results of bid evaluation and contract award shall be published in the 
national  press  or  provincial  press  or  official  gazette  or  a  free  and  open 
access  website  and  shall  identify  the  name  and  offered  price  of  the 
winning  bidder,  as  well  as  the  duration  and  summary  scope  of  the 
awarded contract.  
 

(xiv)  The Project Implementing Entity (Anhui) shall have in place provisions 

for bidders to protest.

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully

determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment  Date, the principal amount  of  the  Loan repayable  by  the  Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such 
withdrawal  in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original 
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two (2) calendar months prior to 
any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating 
the principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated 
as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in  the Approved Currency that is 
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
