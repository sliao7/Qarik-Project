total  principal  amount of the  Loan payable  on each  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").

principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on each  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable
amount  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this

Payment  Date,  the  Borrower shall  repay  the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in
accordance  with  paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on  each
Principal  Payment Date falling after the date of such  withdrawal  in amounts determined  by

Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")  and  the
denominator of which  is the sum  of all  remaining Original  Installment  Shares for Principal
Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as
necessary,  to deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a
Currency  Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts  payable
on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each
Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following
the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any  time  the
Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued  on  or  after  the
respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of such  sub-paragraph  shall  no longer
apply to  any withdrawals  made  after the  adoption of such  billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved  Currency,  the
amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date
occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such
amount  in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior  to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the
exchange rate that reflects the amounts  of principal  in the Approved  Currency  payable  by the  Bank
under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to the Conversion;  or (ii)  if the Bank so  determines
in accordance  with the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the  exchange rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance is  denominated  in  more than one Loan Currency,  the provisions  of
this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so  as to
produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
