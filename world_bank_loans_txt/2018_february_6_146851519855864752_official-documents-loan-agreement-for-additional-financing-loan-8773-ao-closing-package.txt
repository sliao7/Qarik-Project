repayable  by the Borrower  on each  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share for each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such

Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")

Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar months  prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as

following  the date  of withdrawal  and shall  be repayable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal  Payment  Date, the provisions
of such  sub-paragraph shall  no  longer apply to  any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date  occurring during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior  to the Conversion  by  either: (i)  the  exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is  denominated  in more  than one  Loan  Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount denominated
in each Loan  Currency,  so  as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
