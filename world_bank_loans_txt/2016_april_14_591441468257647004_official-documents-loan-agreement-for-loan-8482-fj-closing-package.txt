repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior  to  the Conversion by  either:  (i) the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance is  denominated  in  more  than  one Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the amount  denominated
in each  Loan Currency, so  as to  produce a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such amount.
