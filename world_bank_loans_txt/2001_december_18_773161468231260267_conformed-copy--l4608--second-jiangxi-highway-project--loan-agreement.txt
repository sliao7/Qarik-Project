SCHEDULE 4

Special Account

1.

For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a) the  term  “eligible  Categories”  means  Categories  (1),  (2),  (3)  and  (4)  set  forth  in  the 

table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; 

(b) the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the reasonable cost 
of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan 
allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  eligible  Categories  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c) the  term  “Authorized  Allocation”  means  an  amount  equivalent  to  $10,000,000  to  be 
withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 
3(a)  of  this  Schedule,  provided,  however,  that  unless  the  Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  the 
Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to $5,000,000 until the aggregate 
amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall 
be equal to or exceed the equivalent of $100,000,000.

Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures 

2.
in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been 
3.
duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish 
the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a 
request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not 
exceed  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  Authorized  Allocation.  On  the  basis  of  such  request  or 
requests,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and 
deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i)

For  replenishment  of  the    Special  Account,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the 
Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank 
shall specify.

(ii)

Prior  to  or  at  the  time  of  each  such  request,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the 
Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule  for  the  payment  or  payments  in  respect  of  which  replenishment  is 

requested.  On  the  basis  of  each  such  request,  the  Bank  shall,  on  behalf  of  the 
Borrower,  withdraw  from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the  Special 
Account  such  amount  as  the  Borrower  shall  have  requested  and  as  shall  have 
been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the 
Special Account for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn 
by the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, and 
in  the  respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall  have  been  justified  by  said 
documents and other evidence.

4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower shall, at 
such  time as  the  Bank shall  reasonably  request,  furnish to  the  Bank such  documents  and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  3  of  this  Schedule,  the  Bank  shall  not  be 

5.
required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals should be 
made  by  the  Borrower  directly  from  the  Loan  Account  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

(b) if  the  Borrower  shall  have  failed  to  furnish  to  the  Bank,  within  the  period  of  time 
specified  in  Section  4.01  (b)  (ii)  of  this  Agreement,  any  of  the  audit  reports  required  to  be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts 
for the Special Account;

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention to suspend in 
whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant 
to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

(d) once  the  total  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Loan  allocated  to  the  eligible  Categories, 
minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant 
to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter,  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of  the  remaining  unwithdrawn  amount  of  the 
Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify 
by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent 
that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special 
Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice  will  be  utilized  in  making  payments  for  eligible 
expenditures.

6.
(a) If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  payment  out  of  the  Special 
Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of 
this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, 
promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank:  (A)  provide  such  additional  evidence  as  the  Bank  may 
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the 

Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special 
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or 
refund, as the case may be.

(b) If  the  Bank  shall  have  determined  at  any  time  that  any  amount  outstanding  in  the 
Special  Account  will  not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures,  the 
Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  refund  to  the  Bank  such  outstanding 
amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any portion of 

the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d) Refunds to the  Bank made pursuant to paragraphs  6 (a), (b) and (c) of  this Schedule 
shall  be  credited  to  the  Loan  Account  for  subsequent  withdrawal  or  for  cancellation  in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
