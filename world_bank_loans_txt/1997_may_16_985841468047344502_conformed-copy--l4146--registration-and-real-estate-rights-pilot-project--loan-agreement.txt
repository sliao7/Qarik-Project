to cost the equivalent of $100,000 or more each,  the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank for its prior review draft requests for quotations, a copy of the Borrower’s 
evaluation of quotations report, when quotations have been received and evaluated, and 
the draft contract or purchase order for the goods to be procured.  One conformed copy 
of the contract or purchase order shall be furnished to the Bank promptly after its 
execution or issuance and prior to delivery to the Bank of the first application for 
withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract or purchase 
order, or, where payments are to be made out of the Special Account (SA), a copy of 
the contract or purchase order shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of 
the first payment out of the SA in respect of such contract or purchase order.  In the 
case of contracts or purchase orders subject to prior review, before granting a 
material extension of the stipulated time for performance, agreeing to any 
modification or waiver of the conditions of such contract or purchase order, including 
issuing any change order or orders under such contract or purchase order (except in 
cases of extreme urgency) which would in aggregate increase the original amount of the 
contract or purchase order by more than 15 percent of the original price, the Borrower 
shall inform the Bank of the proposed extension, modification, or change order and the 
reasons therefor.  If the Bank determines that the proposal would be inconsistent with 
the provisions of the Loan Agreement, it shall promptly inform the Borrower and state 
the reasons for its determination.  A copy of all amendments to the purchase order 
shall be furnished to the Bank for its record.

1.
with the provisions of the “Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank 
Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency” published by the Bank in August 
1981 (the Consultant Guidelines).  For complex, time-based assignments, such contracts 
shall be based on the standard form of contract for consultants’ services issued by

of reference for such contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms and 
individuals; (c) assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined by the 
Bank; and (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising 
the contract value to $100,000 equivalent or above; or (e) amendments to contracts for 
the employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to $30,000
