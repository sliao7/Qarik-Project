SCHEDULE 1 
 
Project Description 

 

 
1.B. 

 
1.D. 

2.A. 

 
2.C. 

The objective of the Project is to enhance the conservation of globally significant 
biodiversity in the territory of the Borrower and ensure such biodiversity’s long-
term  sustainability  by  supporting  the  development  and  implementation  of 
market-based  instruments  to  promote  forest  conservation  in  buffer  zones  of 
protected areas and biological corridors connecting them. 

The Project consists of the following parts: 

Part 1: Developing and Implementing Sustainable Financing Mechanisms for the 

Provision of Environmental Services

1.A.  Develop appropriate conservation modalities and identify priority areas for land 
use  practices  needed  to  generate  hydrological  services  in  respect  of  watershed 
conservation,  to  ensure  that  funds  generated  by  the  water  tariff  are  used  to 
effectively generate hydrological services. 

(i)  Strengthen  and  increase  the  capital  of  FBS  thereby  enabling  it  to  provide 
sustainable, long-term financing for areas of globally significant biodiversity; and 
(ii)  develop  additional  financing  sources  to  increase  financial  resources  of  the 
FBS  and  prepare  biodiversity  conservation  models  to  assist  with  the  use  of 
related funds. 

 
1.C.  Develop carbon sequestration projects to finance forest regeneration in degraded 
areas and, in relation thereto, to increase the sale of verified emission reductions 
from forests. 

Foster  a  more  systematic  approach  to  seeking  funding  from  retail  markets  or 
markets based on voluntary contributions to environmental conservation. 

 
Part 2: Scaling-up the PSA Program

Strengthen  FONAFIFO’s  capacity  to  implement  the  expanded  PSA  Program, 
including  with  respect  to  issuance  and  monitoring  of  environmental  service 
contracts  that  generate  global  benefits,  focusing  on  enhancing  monitoring 
activities which specifically support biodiversity conservation in priority areas. 

 
2.B.  Develop  and  introduce  a  more  targeted  and  differentiated  approach  to  improve 

the allocation of PSA Program funds as well as its efficiency. 

Establish  and/or  strengthen  appropriate  systems  to  monitor  the  PSA  Program’s 
effectiveness in generating the desired environmental services. 

7

To finance Contracts with Participating Landholders. 

2.D. 
 
Part 3: Removing barriers for small landholders’ participation in the PSA Program

3.A.  Remove  key  obstacles  that  can  impede  the  participation  by  small  landholders, 
including  the  high  transaction  costs  of  dealing  with  many  individual  small 
landholders  and  the  lack  of  cadastral  plans,  with  specific  focus  on  enhancing 
participation  of  the  marginalized  groups  that  specifically  generate  global 
biodiversity benefits. 

 
3.B.  Develop and implement watershed management plans in three pilot areas of the 

Borrower’s territory with high poverty rates.  

Strengthen the monitoring systems related to measuring socioeconomic impacts 
of  the  PSA  Program,  with a  particular  emphasis  on the  poor and the  small and 
medium  size  landholders, including  with  respect  to  utilization  of  PSA  Program 
resources in indigenous areas of the Borrower’s territory.

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage  of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the 
Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
determined by the Bank by  multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b)  the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency 
Conversion applies.

(a) 

 
(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be 
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such 
withdrawal  in  amounts  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original 
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 

15

withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date 
following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion 
Period,  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of  principal  in  the  Approved  Currency 
payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
