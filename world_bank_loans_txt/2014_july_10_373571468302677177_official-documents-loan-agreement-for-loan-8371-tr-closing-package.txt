SCHEDULE  I

Project  Description

The  objective  of the  Project  is  to assist  the  Republic  of Turkey  in meeting  its  increased
power  demand  by  strengthening  the  transmission  system  and  facilitating  large-scale  renewable
energy  generation.

The Project  consists  of the following  parts:

Part  1. Development  of transmission  infrastructure

Construction  and  equipping  of highly  digitalized  substations,  namely  Can  Basin 380  kV,
Izmir  Basin  380 kV,  and  Vize Basin  380 kV  substations and  any other substations agreed  with  the
Bank,  together  with  associated  grid  connection  structures  for  evacuation  of  wind  power  in  the
Selected  Provinces.

Part 2.  Smart-grid  investments

Carry out  investments  that  enable  the  Borrower  to  monitor  the  transmission  grid  network

status  in  real-time  and  to operate  the entire network  reliably  and  securely,  including:

Upgrading  the  hardware  and  software  of  the  existing  Supervisory  Control  and  Data
Acquisition  ("SCADA")  system  at  the  National  Control  Center,  the  Emergency  National
Control  Center  and  nine  (9)  Regional  Control  Centers  and  addition  of  a  Renewable
Energy  Resource  ("RER")  Operator  Desk on the  SCADA  system.

Installation  of  Remote  Terminal  Units  ("RTU")  in  substations  and  power  plants  to
facilitate  acquisition  of real-time  transmission  network  data.

Installation  of digital  protection  relays  in  the  power  grid to  accelerate  fault  clearing  and
minimize  network  disturbances  and outage  area.

Installation  of shunt reactors  in  the  bulk-transmission  network  to  control  load  flow  and  to
secure  appropriate  system  voltage.

Part 3.  Lapseki  2-Sutluce 2 submarine  power cable

Construction  of a  second  double-circuit  submarine  cable  across the  Dardanelles  Strait.

Part  4.  Strengthening  of transmission  networks

Carry  out  investments  to  strengthen  the  transmission  networks,  including:

Construction  of an underground  cable to  connect  the Yeni  Ambarli  substation  to  the Yeni
Bosna  substation.

Construction  of four (4)  380/154/33  kV  substations  and  related  facilities  in  the  province
of Istanbul,  Antalya  and  Urgup.

Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  fully  withdrawn  as of
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by
multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by
(b) the  Installment  Share  for each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such  repayable  amount  to  be

(b) 

To  the  extent that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have been  withdrawn  as  of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance
as of such  date  in accordance  with  paragraph  I of this Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date falling after  the date of such  withdrawal  in amounts
determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by a
fraction,  the numerator  of which  is  the original  Installment  Share specified  in the
table  in  paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date, such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the purposes  solely of calculating  the principal
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and
outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of

- 15  -

withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing
with  the second  Principal  Payment Date  following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if at  any
time  the  Bank  adopts a  due  date  billing  system  under  which  invoices  are  issued
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of
such  billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be  determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to the  Conversion by  either:  (i) the  exchange  rate that reflects  the amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines 
in  accordance  with  the
Conversion  Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan Currency,  so  as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
