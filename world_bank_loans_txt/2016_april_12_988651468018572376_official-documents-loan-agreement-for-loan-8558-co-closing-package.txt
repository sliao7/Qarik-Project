The  following  table sets forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the Loan and  the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have been  fully withdrawn as of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)
Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal  Payment  Date;  by  (b) the  Installment
Share for each Principal  Payment  Date, such repayable  amount to be adjusted, as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency

Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the Borrower  shall  repay  the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as
of such date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date falling  after the date  of such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by the  Bank by  multiplying the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the  original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the
table  in  paragraph  I of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original
Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining
Original  Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted,  as necessary,  to deduct  any amounts
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion
applies.

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan  withdrawn  within two calendar  months  prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding
on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date of withdrawal  and  shall
be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment  Date  following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if at any
time the  Bank adopts a  due date billing system  under which  invoices  are  issued  on
or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made  after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment  Date occurring during the Conversion  Period, shall  be  determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i) the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating
to the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule  shall apply separately to the amount denominated  in each  Loan
Currency,  so  as to produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
