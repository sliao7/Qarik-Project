reasonably require to constitute by way of security for
the Loan substantially in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.02. To this end, the
Borrower shall execute in favor of the Bank an
irrevocable power of attorney authorizing the Bank, inter
alia, to execute on behalf of the Borrower a legal
mortgage in English form as aforesaid.

      Section 5.03. Except as the Bank may otherwise

                   agreement or instrument; and (B) under a

                   on the basis of the prevailing lawful
                   rate of exchange at which such other
                   currency is, at the time of such
                   valuation, obtainable for the purposes

and services required for the Project and to be financed

withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be
made as follows:

      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank a request or
requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.

      (b)   (i)    For replenishment of the Special
                   Account, the Borrower shall furnish to
                   the Bank requests for deposits into the
                   Special Account at such intervals as the
                   Bank shall specify.

            (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such
                   request, the Borrower shall furnish to
                   the Bank the documents and other
                   evidence required pursuant to
                   paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the
                   payment or payments in respect of which
                   replenishment is requested. On the basis
                   of each such request, the Bank shall, on
                   behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from
                   the Loan Account and deposit into the
                   Special Account such amount as the
                   Borrower shall have requested and as
                   shall have been shown by said documents
                   and other evidence to have been paid out
                   of the Special Account for eligible
                   expenditures.

      All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank
from the Loan Account under the respective eligible

shall have been justified by said documents and other
evidence.

4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the
Special Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the
Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such
documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make
further deposits into the Special Account:

      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the
Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the General
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or

      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories, less the amount of

any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent
of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the
Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the
extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all
such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account
as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.

6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made
for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide
such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall
so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special
Account shall be made until the Borrower have provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.

      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.

      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in the Special Account.

      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to
the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
