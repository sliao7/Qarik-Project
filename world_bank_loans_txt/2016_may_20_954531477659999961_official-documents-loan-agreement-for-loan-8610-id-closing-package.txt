Date,  the principal  amount of the  Loan repayable  by  the  Borrower on  each  Principal  Payment
Date  shall  be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the  extent  that  any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the  first
Principal  Payment  Date, the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of
such date  in accordance  with paragraph  I  of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn after the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on  each
Principal  Payment Date falling after  the date of such  withdrawal  in amounts determined
by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  the  amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the
numerator  of which  is  the original  Installment  Share specified  in the table  in paragraph
I of this  Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")  and
the denominator  of which  is  the sum  of all  remaining  Original  Installment  Shares  for
Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such  date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be
adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this
Schedule,  to which a  Currency Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any  Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding  on
the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be
repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal
Payment  Date  following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if  at  any time
the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under which  invoices  are  issued  on  or  after
the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date, the  provisions  of such  sub-paragraph  shall  no
longer  apply to any withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of such  billing  system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a  Currency
Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved  Currency,
the amount so converted  in the  Approved Currency  that is  repayable  on any Principal  Payment
Date occurring  during  the Conversion  Period,  shall  be determined  by the Bank  by  multiplying
such amount  in its currency  of denomination  immediately prior to the Conversion by either:  (i)
the  exchange  rate that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in the Approved  Currency payable  by
the Bank  under the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank
so determines  in  accordance  with  the Conversion  Guidelines,  the exchange  rate component  of
the Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated  in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions
of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each  Loan  Currency,  so
as  to  produce  a  separate  amortization  schedule  for  each such  amount.
