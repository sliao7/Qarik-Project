LOAN AGREEMENT 
 
Agreement  dated  December  3,  2009,  entered  into  between  UNITED  MEXICAN  STATES 
(“Borrower”) represented by its signatory on page 5 of this Agreement and INTERNATIONAL 
BANK  FOR  RECONSTRUCTION  AND  DEVELOPMENT  (“Bank”)  for  the  purpose  of 
providing  financing  in support  of  the  Program  (as defined in the  Appendix to  this  Agreement).  
The Bank has decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions which 
the  Borrower  has  already  taken  under  the  Program  and  which  are  described  in  Section  I  of 
Schedule  1  to  this  Agreement;  and  (b)  the  Borrower’s  maintenance  of  an  appropriate  macro-
economic policy framework.   
 
Whereas the Borrower has informed the Bank that the proceeds of the Loan (as set forth in the 
table in Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement and for purposes of supporting the Program), 
shall  be  used  in  conformity  with  the  requirements  of  the  Borrower’s  income,  budgetary  and 
public  debt  laws  and  the terms  of  this  Agreement,  the  Borrower  and  the  Bank  hereby  agree  as 
follows: 

 

 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS

integral part of this Agreement.

the  meanings  ascribed  to  them  in  the  General  Conditions  or  in  the  Appendix  to  this 
Agreement. 

 
ARTICLE II — LOAN 
 
2.01.  The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or referred 
to  in  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of  one  billion  five  hundred  and  three  million  seven 
hundred and fifty thousand Dollars ($1,503,750,000), as such amount may be converted 
from time to time through a Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 2.07 of this Agreement (“Loan”). 

 
2.02.  As a consequence of the Borrower’s maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic policy 
framework  and  its  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Program,  the  Borrower  may 
withdraw  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan in  accordance  with  Section  II  of  Schedule  1  to  this 
Agreement.  The Borrower’s representative for purposes of taking any action required or 
permitted to be taken pursuant to this Section are the Director General of BANSEFI, or 
the  Director  General  Adjunto  de  Banca  Institucional  of BANSEFI  or  any  person  or 
persons whom such representatives shall jointly or severally designate in writing. 

 
2.03.  The Front-end Fee payable by the Borrower shall be equal to one quarter of one percent 

(0.25%).  

2.04.   The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate equal to 
LIBOR  for  the  Loan  Currency  plus  the  Variable  Spread;  provided,  that  upon  a 
Conversion of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the interest payable 
by  the  Borrower  during  the  Conversion  Period  on  such  amount  shall  be  determined  in 
accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  Article  IV  of  the  General  Conditions.  
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if  any  amount  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  remains 
unpaid  when  due  and  such  non-payment  continues  for  a  period  of  thirty  days,  then  the 
interest payable by the Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 
(d) of the General Conditions. 

 
2.05.  The Payment Dates are May 15 and November 15 in each year. 
 
2.06.  The  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  shall  be  repaid  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of

2.07. 

(a)

terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: (i) a change of 
the  Loan  Currency  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan, 
withdrawn  or  unwithdrawn,  to  an  Approved  Currency;  (ii)  a  change  of  the 
interest rate basis applicable to all or any portion of the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice 
versa; and (iii) the setting of limits on the Variable Rate applicable to all or any 
portion  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  by  the 
establishment  of  an  Interest  Rate  Cap  or  Interest  Rate  Collar  on  the  Variable 
Rate. 

 

 

(b)

General  Conditions,  and  shall  be  effected  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion Guidelines.  

Promptly following the Execution Date for an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate 
Collar for which the Borrower has requested that the premium be paid out of the 
proceeds of the Loan, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from 
the  Loan  Account  and  pay  to  itself  the  amounts  required  to  pay  any  premium

disbursement  by  the  Bank  to  the  Borrower  of  Loan  proceeds  in 
compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and 

(ii) 

the  Borrower,  through  SHCP,  shall  cooperate  fully  with  BANSEFI  to

obligations  under  the  Contrato  de  Mandato  in  such  a  manner  as  to  protect  the 
interests of the Bank and to accomplish the purposes of the Loan.  Except as the 
Bank may otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not amend or fail to enforce any 
provision of the Contrato de Mandato. In case of any conflict between the terms

Agreement shall prevail.

The actions taken by the Borrower under the Program include the following: 
 
1.  
The Borrower has implemented countercyclical fiscal stimulus measures during the first 
semester of 2009, as demonstrated by: (i) an increase, in real terms, of the Current Spending by 
5.4  percent;  and  (ii)  an  increase,  in  real  terms,  of  the  Induced  Physical  Capital  Investment 
Spending by 27.7 percent, both increases as determined by comparing the Current Spending and 
the Induced Physical Capital Investment Spending incurred between January 1, 2008 and June 30, 
2008, and the Current Spending and the Induced Physical Capital Investment Spending incurred 
between January 1, 2009 and June 30, 2009. 
 
2.  
The  Borrower  has  submitted  to  Congress  an  economic  program  for  fiscal  year  2010 
(programa  económico  para  el  ejercicio  fiscal  2010) on September  8,  2009,  consisting  of  the 
general criteria for economic policy, the proposed revenue law for fiscal year 2010, the proposed 
budget decree for fiscal year 2010, and various tax and fiscal proposals.  Said economic program 
includes: 
 

the  creation  of  new  taxes  and  modification  of  existing  taxes  (including  an 
increase in tax rates); and 

a temporary deficit and the use of non-recurrent revenues, including withdrawals 
from stabilization funds, in order to compensate the temporary shortfall in public 
sector  revenue,  all  of  this,  in  accordance  with  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and 
Budget Law. 

 
The  Borrower  has  issued  the  General  Governmental  Accounting  Law  to  harmonize 
3.  
accounting  standards  among  the  federal,  state  and  municipal  levels  of  the  executive  branch  of 
government. 

The  Borrower  has  enhanced  consumer  protection,  access  to  finance  and  market 

4.  
transparency by:  
 

amending the Law for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services 
to expand the regulatory and supervisory capacities of CONDUSEF;  

amending  Article  46  Bis  1  of  the  Credit  Institutions  Law  to  facilitate  the 
provision  of  banking  services  by  third  parties  subcontracted  by  a  banking 
institution  authorized  to  do  so  by  the  CNBV  (as  said  Article  46  Bis  1  was 
amended on June 25, 2009); and  

amending fraction VI Bis of article 104 of the Securities Market Law requiring 
issuers  to  provide  information  to  the  CNBV  and  to  relevant  stock  exchanges 
about  the  issuer  derivative  positions  and  possible  contingencies  that  said 
derivative positions imply for the relevant issuer’s financial situation.

institutions.  Among other provisions, said amendment establishes that:  
 

 state-owned  development  financial 
institutions  shall  publish  monitoring 
indicators that evaluate the services provided by the relevant institution (Art. 31 
of the Credit Institutions Law, as said article was amended on May 6, 2009), and  

 SHCP shall annually carry out and publish two evaluations (in which at least two 
academic  institutions  need  to  participate)  of  said  state-owned  development 
financial institutions (Art. 55 Bis 2 of the Credit Institutions Law, as said article 
was amended on May 6, 2009). 

The Borrower has strengthened and enhanced its active labor market policies by: 

improving  the  institutional  set-up  of  the  Borrower’s  Temporary  Employment 
Program  (Programa  de  Empleo  Temporal) by including  the  Borrower’s  Sub-
secretariat  of  Employment  and  Labor  Productivity  (Subsecretaría  de  Empleo  y 
Productividad  Laboral)
in  the  technical  committee  that  coordinates  said 
Temporary Employment Program, and  
 
allowing said Temporary Employment Program to be implemented in urban areas 
in addition to rural areas. 

 
7.  
The Borrower has issued the Decree Amending the Tariff for General Taxes on Imports 
and Exports Law in order to enhance trade, competitiveness and simplification of the Borrower’s 
external  trade  tariff  structure,  by  reducing  the  most-favored-nation  tariffs  on  manufacturing 
imports and increasing the number of duty-free tariff lines in a staged manner, over a five year 
period, starting January 1, 2009.
