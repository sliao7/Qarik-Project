The  following  table  sets  forth  the Principal  Payment  Dates of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the  first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date  shall be determined by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the first Principal
Payment Date; by (b)  the Installment  Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount to be  adjusted, as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts  referred  to

(a) 

(b) 

To the  extent that any proceeds  of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1 of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on or  after  such
date,  such amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4  of this Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan  withdrawn within  two calendar months prior to any
Principal  Payment Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the

-19-

principal  amounts  payable  on any Principal  Payment  Date, be  treated as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion of all or  any portion of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying  such amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to  the Conversion by either:  (i)  the exchange rate
that reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under the Currency Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component of the Screen Rate.

5. 

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated in  more than  one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to the amount denominated
in each  Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such amount.
