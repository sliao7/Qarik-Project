SCHEDULE 4

Procurement and Consultants' Services

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works

Part A: International Competitive Bidding

1. Except as provided in Part D hereof, goods and works shall be

procured under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures

consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the

"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"

published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines).

(a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid

referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that,

when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity

period, the successful bidder's bid price will be increased for each

week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to

the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign currency components and

the other to the local currency component of the bid price. Such an

increase shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation.

(b) In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with

this Part A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding

documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the

Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the

Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been

issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based

on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the

Bank.

2. To the extent practicable, contracts shall be grouped into bid

packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more.

3. For the purposes of the pre-shipment inspection of goods

imported under the Project, no price verification shall be conducted

in respect of those goods to which Part A of this Section applies.

Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures

described in Part A.1 hereof, goods manufactured in Zimbabwe may be

granted a margin of preference in accordance with, and subject to,
the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of 
the Guidelines and

paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto.

Part C: Preference for Domestic Contractors

In the procurement of works in accordance with 
the procedures

described in Part A.1 hereof, the Borrower may 
grant a margin of

preference to domestic contractors in accordance 
with, and subject

to, the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of 
the Guidelines and

paragraph 5 of Appendix 2 thereto.

Part D: Other Procurement Procedures

1. Contracts for the supply and installation 
of proprietary goods

under Part B of the Project shall be procured on 
a negotiated basis

from the original manufacturer or authorized representatives 
of such

goods, on terms satisfactory to the Bank provided 
however that the

aggregate amount of such contracts shall 
not exceed $29,000,000

equivalent.

2. Workshop equipment which cannot be grouped in 
bidding packages

estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent or more, 
up to an aggregate

amount not to exceed the equivalent of $1,000,000, 
may be procured

under contracts awarded on the basis of 
comparison of price

quotations solicited from a list of at least three 
suppliers from at

least two different countries eligible under the 
Guidelines, in

accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.

Part E: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions

1. Review of invitations to bid and of proposed 
awards and final

contracts:

(a) With respect to each contract estimated 
to cost the

equivalent of $500,000 or more, the procedures 
set forth in

paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines 
shall apply.

Where payments for such contract are to be made 
out of the Special

Account, such procedures shall be modified to 
ensure that the two

conformed copies of the contract required to be 
furnished to the

Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished 
to the Bank

prior to the making of the first payment out 
of the Special Account

in respect of such contract.

(b) With respect to each contract not governed 
by the pre-

ceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 
3 and 4 of
Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such

contract are to be made out of the Special Account, such procedures

shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the

contract together with the other information required to be

furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be

furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished

pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall

not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals from the Loan

Account are to be made on the basis of statements of expenditure.

2. The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of

paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines.

Section II. Employment of Consultants

1. In order to assist the Borrower in the carrying out of the

Project, the Borrower shall employ consultants whose qualifications,

experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be

satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in

accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank

on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World

Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency" published

by the Bank in August 1981. For complex, time-based assignments, the

Borrower shall employ such consultants under contracts using the

standard form of Contract for Consultants' Services issued by the

Bank, with such modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank.

Where no relevant standard contract documents have been issued by

the Bank, the Borrower shall use other standard forms agreed upon

with the Bank.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section,

the provisions of the Consultants' Guidelines requiring prior Bank

review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures,

letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts

shall not apply to contracts estimated to cost less than $100,000

equivalent each. However, this exception to prior Bank review shall

not apply to the terms of reference for such contracts nor to the

employment of individuals, to single source selection of firms, to

assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the

Bank, and to amendments of contracts raising the contract value to

$100,000 equivalent or above.
SCHEDULE 5

Special Account

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a) the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1) and

(2) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this

Agreement;

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in

respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for

the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan

allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance

with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount

equivalent to $4,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and

deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of

this Schedule.

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively

for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this

Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that

the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the

Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the

Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a

deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the

Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the

Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan

Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts

as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for

deposits into the Special Account at such

intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to, or at the time of each such request,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
documents and other evidence required pursuant to

paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or

payments in respect of which replenishment is

requested. On the basis of each such request, the

Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw

from the Loan Account and deposit into the

Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall

have requested and as shall have been shown by

said documents and other evidence to have been

paid out of the Special Account for eligible

expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan

Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the

respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said

documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special

Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other

evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible

expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this

Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits

into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the

Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the

General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this

Agreement; or

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated

to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding

special comitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02

of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal

the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories

of the Project shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall

specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be

made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been

satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized 
in making

payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined 
at any time that any

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was 
made for an expenditure

or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this

Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence 
furnished to the

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon 
notice from the Bank

(A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank 
may request, or

(B) deposit into the Special Account (or, 
if the Bank shall so

request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal 
to the amount of such

payment or the portion thereof not so eligible 
or justified. Unless

the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further 
deposit by the Bank into

the Special Account shall be made until the 
Borrower has provided

such evidence or made such deposit or refund, 
as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at 
any time that any

amount outstanding in the Special Account will 
not be required to

cover further payments for eligible expenditures, 
the Borrower

shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, 
refund to the Bank such

outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, 
refund to the

Bank all or any portion of the funds on 
deposit in the Special

Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to 
paragraph 6 (a),

(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited 
to the Loan Account

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the

relevant provisions of this Agreement, 
including the General

Conditions.
