SCHEDULE 2 

Description of the Project 

The objective of the Project is to improve the financial stability and outreach 
capacity of SCIs throughout Mexico, with emphasis on those serving rural areas of the 
country, to thus contribute to the integration of low-income populations into the Mexican 
economy by increasing such populations’ access to financial services and consequently 
aid in the realization of such populations’ income-generating potential.  

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives: 

Part A: Strengthening of SCIs and of the Regulatory Supervision Thereof

1. (a) Carrying out of assessments of the financial and managerial condition of 
individual SCIs so as to determine whether an SCI qualifies for authorization by CNBV 
to operate as an Entidad, whether an SCI requires technical assistance for its 
strengthening or restructuring (such as by merger with another SCI) in order to qualify 
for such authorization, or whether an SCI should be liquidated; (b) provision of technical 
assistance to individual SCIs to support the design and implementation of institutional 
strengthening plans to allow them to qualify for such authorization; and (c) provision of 
technical assistance in support of the liquidation of unviable SCIs. 

2. Design, establishment and operation of an information system in support of the 
SCI sector, to allow SCIs to generate and disseminate information for their own use and 
that of sector regulatory bodies such as CNBV. 

3. Carrying out of a training program, for the staff of SCIs, focusing on the areas of 
finance, accounting, risk management, credit analysis and governance. 

4. Provision of technical assistance and training to CNBV to strengthen its capacity 
to supervise the SCI sector and to aid in the development and adaptation of regulations 
required to support such supervision, as well as provision of technical assistance and 
training to Federaciones and Confederaciones in support of the auxiliary supervisory 
roles they play as a supplement to CNBV’s overarching supervisory role.
Part B: Expansion of Financial Services in Rural Areas

1. Provision of technical assistance to individual SCIs to support the design and 
implementation of regional development plans to allow them to increase their financial 
services outreach to low-income rural populations within the Expansion Project Area that 
are underserved by the financial services sector (if necessary through the establishment of 
additional  SCIs or through the establishment – – of new branch offices, in which case the 
new offices or additional  SCIs may, as part of the technical assistance package, receive 
computer equipment and software supplied by the technical assistance providers). 

2. Provision of training to low-income rural populations in the Expansion Project 
Area on basic principles of household finance and participation in financial transactions. 

Part C: SCI Sector Studies, Monitoring and Information Dissemination

1. (a) Carrying out of studies regarding, inter alia, financial intermediation, 
sector performance and auxiliary supervision with a view to identify explanatory factors 
for performance, draw lessons from Project results and identify areas for improvement 
and innovation; (b) carrying out of a program, including workshops and information 
campaigns, to inform SCIs, their clients and other stakeholders of reforms in the SCI 
sector and to disseminate lessons from experience in the areas of microfinance, savings 
mobilization, and auxiliary supervision; and (c) carrying out of activities to monitor and 
evaluate Project implementation, development of the SCI sector, impact of sectoral 
reforms and performance of individual SCIs (including the carrying out – on a sample 
basis nationwide – of technical and financial audits of SCIs supported by the Project and 
periodic external evaluations of the sector carried out by Mexican and international 
consultants). 

2. (a) Carrying out of studies of financial intermediation in rural areas and 
other areas underserved by the Mexican financial services sector, with a view to defining 
new financial methodologies adapted to local conditions; and (b) carrying out of 
activities, supplemental to those described in Part C.1 (c) above, to monitor and evaluate 
Project implementation, development of the SCI sector, impact of sectoral reforms and 
performance of individual SCIs (including the carrying out of technical and financial 
audits of all SCIs supported by Part B of the Project).  

Part D: Project Management
1. Provision of technical assistance, training and material support to the Core Team 
in order to assist in its Project implementation functions. 

2. Provision of technical assistance, training and material support to the Technical 
Unit in order to assist in its Project implementation functions.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 
the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 
Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

 Installment Share 
 Payment Date (Expressed as a %)

On each March 15 and September 15 

Beginning March 15, 2008 
 through September 15, 2017 5% 

2. If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original 
Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate. 

5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 
amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as 
the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made
