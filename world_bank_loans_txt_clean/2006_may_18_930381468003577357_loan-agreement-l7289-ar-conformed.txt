Description of the Project 

The objective of the Project is to reduce the Borrower’s vulnerability to flooding 
through the improvement of the level of protection of the Borrower’s rain drainage 
system and the implementation of a risk management program. 

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objective: 

Part A: Non-Structural Measures

1. Design and implementation of a risk management program, which program 
includes, inter alia: (a) the design of hazard maps that will identify the areas at risk based 
on a number of factors such as typology, frequency of flooding, land use and magnitude 
of natural events; (b) the design of vulnerability maps that will identify the private and 
public infrastructure at risk, and the appropriate uses of areas at risk; (c) the design of 
land use plans or maps (as the case may be) that will identify the areas at risk and 
appropriate uses of said areas for purposes of developing risk management regulations; 
and (d) the identification and prioritization of risk mitigation measures, and the 
preparation of an action plan to implement said measures, when needed.  

2. Installation and operation of a hydro-meteorological warning system.  

3. Based on the information generated as a result of the carrying out of the activities 
mentioned in Part A.1 above, preparation of norms and/or bills of laws (as the case may 
be, all acceptable to the Bank) so as to update the Borrower’s existing urban legal and 
regulatory framework. 

 4. Identification of alternatives for the transfer, treatment and final disposal of solid 
waste produced in the Borrower’s territorial jurisdiction to improve solid waste 
management and waste recycling. 

5.  (a)  Development of the initial phase of a green spaces master plan, which 
phase includes, inter alia, the carrying out of a diagnostic of green spaces located within 
the Borrower’s territorial jurisdiction, the carrying out of topographic surveys of soil and 
trees, the design of guidelines to develop the final phase of said green spaces master plan, 
and the acquisition and utilization of the equipment required therefor; and (b) carrying
out of an update of the Borrower’s inventory of public trees so as to develop a public 
trees replenishment master plan. 

6. Design and implementation of a hydrological environmental, communications 
and education program, which program would consist of, inter alia, informing the Project 
stakeholders and population in general of the contents of the Project (including the 
design, printing and distribution of materials required therefor). 

7. Design and implementation of a program to strengthen the institutional, 
operational and risk management capacity of the City Departments, if needed. 

8. Carrying out of periodic water quality and quantity evaluations in a manner 
acceptable to the Bank. 

Part B: Development of Key Defense Facilities

1. (a) Construction of two drainage/collection tunnels of approximately 9900 
and 4700 meters long, respectively (each with an internal diameter of 6.90 meters) in the 
Maldonado basin, which will run parallel to the Maldonado underground channel; (b) 
carrying out of technical studies in respect of complementary work for the construction of 
the tunnels mentioned in (a) herein; (c) carrying out of the construction supervision of the 
tunnels mentioned in (a) herein; and (d) selection and hiring of a group of independent 
advisors under terms of reference and with qualifications and experience acceptable to 
the Bank to address any procurement and/or construction problems which may arise 
during the carrying out of the works referred to in Part B.1 (a) of the Project. 

2.  Improvement of the existing water drainage system in the Maldonado basin, 
through the expansion of the secondary water drainage network. 

3. Carrying out of feasibility studies in all water basins within the Borrower’s 
territorial jurisdiction (other than in the Maldonado basin) for purposes of designing, 
immediately after the completion of said studies, water drainage investments which 
would improve the water drainage system in said basins. 

Part C: Technical Assistance and Auditing

1. Strengthening the capacity of the DGRBM-SUPCE to perform its functions and 
responsibilities referred to in Section 3.06 (a) of this Agreement, including the acquisition 
and utilization of the goods required therefor.

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw

the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, 
if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such 
payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made 
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the
