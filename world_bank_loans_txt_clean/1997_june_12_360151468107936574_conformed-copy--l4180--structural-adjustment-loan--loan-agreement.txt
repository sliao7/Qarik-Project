as hereinafter provided;

NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

this Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the proceeds of the Loan from 
the Loan Account in support of the Program. 

(b) The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank, the first

All withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit 
Account.

(c) The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used 
to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan 
shall have been used to make a payment for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment; or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, 
refund such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall 
be credited to the Loan Account for cancellation. 

Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be March 31, 1998 or such later date as the 
Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later date. 

Section 2.04. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment charge at the rate 
of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per annum on the principal amount of the 
Loan not withdrawn from time to time.  

Section 2.05. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of the

date of this Agreement to, but excluding, the first Interest Payment Date 
occurring thereafter, and after the initial period, each period 
from and including an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding the 
next following Interest Payment Date. 

(ii) “Interest Payment Date” means any date specified in Section 2.06 
of this Agreement. 

(iii) “LIBOR Base Rate” means, for each Interest Period, the London 
interbank offered rate for six-month deposits in single 
currency for value the first day of such Interest Period (or, in the case 
of the initial Interest Period, for value the Interest Payment Date 
occurring on or next preceding the first day of such Interest Period), 
as reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage per 
annum.

(iv) “LIBOR Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: (A) one half 
of one percent (1/2 of 1%); (B) minus (or plus) the weighted 
average margin, for such Interest Period, below (or above) the London

deposits, in respect of the Bank’s outstanding borrowings or 
portions thereof allocated by the Bank to fund single currency loans

determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage per annum.

Spread for each Interest Period, promptly upon the determination thereof. 

(d) Whenever, in light of changes in market practice affecting the 
determination of the interest rates referred to in this Section 2.05, the Bank 
determines that it is in the interest of its borrowers as a whole and of the Bank to 
apply a basis for determining the interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as 
provided in said Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest 
rates applicable to the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower 
of the new basis. The basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice period 
unless the Borrower notifies the Bank during said period of its objection thereto, in 
which case said modification shall not apply to the Loan.

Section 2.06. Interest and other charges shall be payable March 15 and September 
15 in each year.

Section 2.07. The Borrower shall repay the principal amount of the Loan in 
accordance with the amortization schedule set forth in Schedule 2 to this Agreement.
