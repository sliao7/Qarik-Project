President of the People’s Republic of China on August 30, 1999, with the 

following clarifications required for compliance with the Guidelines: 

(i) All invitations to prequalify or to bid shall be advertised in a newspaper 
of national circulation in the Borrower’s country, except works contracts

$2,000,000 equivalent each or goods contracts that are estimated to cost 

less than $300,000 equivalent each, which may be advertised in a

such security. In place of a bid security, the bidding documents may

performance security before the deadline required in the bidding

required to be present at the bid opening. 

(vii) All bid evaluation criteria shall be disclosed in the bidding documents 
and quantified in monetary terms or expressed in the form of pass/fail 

requirements.

any standard contract estimate, or margin or bracket of average bids 

established by the Borrower or Project Implementing Entity (Anhui). 

(ix) Each contract shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive 
bidder, that is, the bidder who meets the appropriate standards of 

capability and resources and whose bid has been determined: (A) to be
substantially responsive to the bidding documents; and (B) to offer the 

lowest evaluated cost. The winning bidder shall not be required, as a 

condition of award, to undertake responsibilities for work not stipulated 

in the bidding documents or otherwise to modify the bid as originally 

submitted.

the suppliers and contractors shall permit the Bank, at its request, to 

inspect their accounts and records relating to the performance of the 

contract and to have said accounts and records audited by auditors 

appointed by the Bank.

they: (A) are legally and financially autonomous; (B) operate under 

commercial law; and (C) are not a dependent agency of the agency 

conducting the procurement.

place without the Bank’s prior written concurrence.

national press or provincial press or official gazette or a free and open

of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 

the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original 

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 

Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two (2) calendar months prior to 

any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating 

the principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated 

as withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 

following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 

Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 

invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 

withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 

Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
