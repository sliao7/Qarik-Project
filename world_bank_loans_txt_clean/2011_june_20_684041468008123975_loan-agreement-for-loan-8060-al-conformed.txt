Section I. Actions under the Program.   

Actions to be Taken Under the Program.  The actions taken by the Borrower under the 

Program include the following: 

1. The Borrower has issued the Amendment of Law on Social Assistance and Services 
which, inter alia, revised the Ndihma Ekonomike Social Assistance Program resource 

allocation system to municipalities by adding a poverty criterion, and by defining 

household eligibility criteria based on a unified scoring formula, with weights across 

variables associated with economic and poverty status.

2. The Borrower’s Council of Ministers issued Decisions No. 602, 603 and 604 on July 23, 
2010, which, inter alia, changed the indexation formula for the Disability Program by de-

linking the calculation of increases in benefits from wage indexation and linking 

increases in benefit to inflation instead.

3. The Borrower has issued the Amendment of Law on Social Assistance and Services 
which, inter alia, introduced for households receiving assistance under the Ndihma 

Ekonomike Social Assistance Program, a bonus for their school-age children’s 

attendance in compulsory education.

4. The Borrower has issued the Amendment of Law on Social Assistance and Services 
which, inter alia, mandated the creation of an automated national registry for applicants 

and beneficiaries of social assistance programs.

5. The Borrower has issued the Law on Mandatory Insurance for Healthcare which, inter 
alia, authorized HII to extend coverage of health insurance to Ndihma Ekonomike Social 

Assistance Program beneficiaries and established a package of benefits, thereby enabling 

the cost of providing health services to be estimated.

6. The Borrower has issued the Law on Mandatory Insurance for Healthcare which, inter 
alia, defined a systematic rule to transfer resources to HII, using the cost of services as a 

criterion for the transfer, and maintained payroll contribution at the current level.

7. The Borrower’s Council of Ministers issued Decision No. 1661 dated December 29, 
2008,  which, inter alia, unified the publicly funded purchasing of health services under 

one agency, by transferring financing of hospitals to HII.
 
  Additionally, HII has signed 

performance contracts with thirty-nine hospitals.  

Section II. Availability of Loan Proceeds 

A. General.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance with the 

provisions of this Section and such additional instructions as the Bank may specify by 

notice to the Borrower.
B. Allocation of Loan Amounts.  The Loan (except for amounts required to pay the Front-

end Fee) is allocated in a single withdrawal tranche, from which the Borrower may make 

withdrawals of the Loan proceeds.  The allocation of the amounts of the Loan to this end 

is set out in the table below: 

Allocations Amount of the Loan 

(expressed in Euro) 

(1) Single Withdrawal Tranche 18,054,750

      TOTAL AMOUNT 18,100,000

satisfied: (a) with the Program being carried out by the Borrower; and (b) with the 

appropriateness of the Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework. 

D. Deposits of Loan Amounts.  Except as the Bank may otherwise agree:   

1. all withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into an account 

designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank; and 

2.  the Borrower shall ensure that upon each deposit of an amount of the Loan into this 

account, an equivalent amount is accounted for in the Borrower’s budget management 

system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. 

E. Excluded Expenditures.  The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall 

not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines at any time that an 

amount of the Loan was used to make a payment for an Excluded Expenditure, the 

Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund an amount equal to the 

amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request 

shall be cancelled. 

F. Closing Date.  The Closing Date is April 30, 2012.
SCHEDULE 2 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 

Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 

the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 

Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 

multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by 

(b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 

adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 

to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date 

Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 

On each April 15 and October 15 

Beginning October 15, 2016 

 through April 15, 2026 

5% 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 

Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 

as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 

determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 

fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 

table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 

Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 

Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 

date[, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 

amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 

Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 

amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 

outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 

with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 

on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-

paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 

such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 

Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 

Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 

the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 

to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 

the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 

relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 

Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 

Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount
