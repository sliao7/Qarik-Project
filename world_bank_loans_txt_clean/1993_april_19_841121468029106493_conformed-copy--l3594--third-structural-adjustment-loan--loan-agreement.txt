Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the 
Guidelines), subject to the following modifications:

(a) Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the following is 
substituted therefor:

"2.8 Notification and Advertising

The international community should be notified in a timely manner of the 
opportunity to bid. This will be done by advertising invitations to apply for 
inclusion in a bidder’s invitation list, to apply for prequalification, or to bid; 
such advertisements should be placed in at least one newspaper of general 
circulation in the Borrower’s country and, in addition, in at least one of the 
following forms:

(i) a notice in the United Nations publication, Development Business; 
or

(ii) an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or technical journal 
of wide international circulation; or

(iii) a notice to local representatives of countries and territories 
referred to in the Guidelines, that are potential suppliers of the 
goods required."

(b) The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of the Guidelines:

"As a further alternative, bidding documents may require the bidder to 
state the bid price in a single currency widely used in international trade and 
specified in the bidding documents."

(c) Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.
 
2. Subject to paragraph 3 below, contracts for the procurement of goods estimated 
to cost the equivalent of less than $5,000,000 shall be awarded:

(a) by purchasers required to follow the Borrower’s public procurement 
procedures for the importation of goods, on the basis of such procedures, provided 
that such procedures shall have been found acceptable by the Bank; and

(b) by other purchasers, in accordance with established commercial practice, 
provided that such contracts shall be awarded on the basis of evaluation and 
comparison of quotations obtained from suppliers, except that direct contracting 
procedures acceptable to the Bank may be used where considered appropriate under 
paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines.

3. Subject to the prior approval of the Bank, commonly traded commodities may be 
procured through organized international commodity markets or other channels of 
competitive procurement

entered into with oil suppliers,
the Bank shall finance out of the Loan an amount not to exceed, per unit, the average 
between lower and higher FOB (free on board) prices as reflected in the Platt’s 
Oilgram for the US Gulf Coast or
the Caribbean, as applicable, for the relevant date of loading (with due adjustment 
for type and quality of crude or petroleum product) plus the ocean freight rates that 
would apply to the largest tankers that can be handled at the receiving terminal, 
insurance and inspection costs, and ocean losses allowances; or (b) in respect of 

other commodity imports under existing contracts entered into with the corresponding 
suppliers, the Bank shall finance out of the Loan an amount not to exceed the average 
FOB (free on board) price posted (for the commodity in question and for the relevant 
date of shipment) by a commodity exchange acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank plus 
the additional costs referred to above, if applicable.

4. With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 1 of this Schedule, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the submission to the Bank of the first 
application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract, 
two conformed copies of such contract, together with the analysis of the respective 
bids and recommendations for award, a description of the advertising and tendering 
procedures followed and such other information as the Bank shall reasonably request.

5. With respect to each contract referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this 
Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the submission to the Bank 
of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect 
thereof, such documentation and information as the Bank may reasonably request to 
support withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.

6. The provisions of the preceding paragraph 5 of this Schedule shall not apply to
