I of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share") and

the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for

such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i)

the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by

the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion, or (ii) if the Bank

so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of
