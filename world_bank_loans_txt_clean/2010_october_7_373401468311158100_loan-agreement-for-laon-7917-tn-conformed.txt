farmers to encourage its reuse in agriculture in the Borj Touil area. 

The Project consists of the following parts: 

Part A: Transfer of Treated Wastewater (TWW) to Increase its Reuse in Agriculture 

1. Installation of two HDPE pipelines of 1800 mm of diameter to convey the TWW 

under the El Khelij Canal, through a siphon, and along an existing dirt road until 

a ‘storage and regulation’ basin located about 2.7 km north from the discharge 

point, through the carrying out of works and the provisions of goods. 

2. Installation of a two-compartment basin of a capacity of 160,000 m3 and 

covering about six (6) hectares to segregate and store TWW based on its quality 

through the carrying out of works and the provisions of goods.

the outflow towards the reuse infrastructure as well as the transfer pipes and 

submarine outfall through the carrying out of works and the provisions of goods. 

4. Provision of equipment necessary to ensure the quality operation and appropriate 

maintenance of the pipelines, basin and pumping station under this Part A of the 

Project. 

Part B: Improvement of the Discharge of the Remaining TWW in the Mediterranean Sea

remaining TWW in the Mediterranean Sea through: 

1. Installation of one pressure HDPE pipeline of 1600 mm of diameter to convey 

the TWW for about five (5) km from the storage basin to the submarine outfall 

following the right side of the El Hissiène Oued, through the carrying out of 

works and the provisions of goods. 

2. Construction of about six (6) km long submarine outfall to discharge the TWW at 

a depth of about twenty (20) meters, through the carrying out of works and the 

provisions of goods.
3. Conducting a detailed review of the design of the submarine outfall and 

supervising the critical phases of its construction, through the provision of 

consultants’ services. 

Part C: Monitoring and Capacity Strengthening
