The objective of the Project is to support the transition of the electricity social tariff scheme from 
the federal to the Buenos Aires provincial level, while strengthening the institutional capacity of the PBA 
to implement ST delivery. 

The Project consists of the following parts: 

Part 1: Institutional Capacity Building on ST Implementation and Energy Efficiency 

1.1. 

1.2; 
Institutional Strengthening on ST Management, Information Procedures, and Transparency. 
Carrying out activities focused on: (a) enhancing the PBA’s institutional structure to manage the 
ST, including the review of roles and responsibilities to implement and monitor the ST; (b) 
providing solutions to information gaps of the ST by improving management procedures and 
strengthening the data systems of the DPSS and the DPSP; and (c) improving transparency through 
access to information on ST, and upgrading grievance mechanisms related to ST; through, inter 
alia: (i) development of agreements with protocols and related software for systemic exchange of 

information among Regulatory Agencies and the PBA; (ii) provision of equipment to strengthen 
the information technology capacity of agencies participating in ST implementation; (iii) carrying 

out of training of provincial agencies and distribution companies on new procedures and 
information mechanisms; (iv) support to improve regulatory agencies’ grievance redress 
mechanism; (v) data exchange with other public stakeholders at the federal and provincial levels; 
(vi) consolidation of a unified data collection system on electricity user; and (vii) development and 
publication of a regular report on ST. 

Gathering Information at the Local Level and from other Provincial and National Agencies. 
Carrying out activities focused on: (a) updating electricity user’s information from the field (re- 

empadronamiento) and other complementary actions, especially for the users without identification 
data; and (b) combining additional administrative sources for cross-checks to provide information 

on users without socio-economic attributes; through, inter alia: (i) support to selected distribution 
companies for improving beneficiary information; (ii) development of coordination activities and 
protocols for transferring the data from OCEBA and ENRE to the PBA’s database; (iii) carrying 
out of communication campaigns and preparation of dissemination materials for electricity users 
on eligibility criteria for ST and the need for updating their identification data; (iv) support for the 

combination of additional administrative sources to ensure interoperability across different 
databases (for cross-checks); and (v) definition of unified criteria and procedures to assess ST 
inclusion by claims and ad hoc mechanisms. 

Assessing the ST and Promoting Energy Efficiency Behavior. Carrying out activities focused on: 
(a) strengthening the PBA’s analytical capabilities to evaluate ST policies to generate evidence- 
based recommendations and guidelines; (b) assessing, designing, and implementing energy 
efficiency measures for ST beneficiaries through, inter alia: (i) development of tools and 
instruments to combine data sources and perform distributive analysis on ST and other subsidies; 
(ii) carrying out of an evaluation of the electricity ST to identify potential measures or reforms that 
can substantially reduce inclusion and exclusion errors; (iii) knowledge sharing on electricity social 
tariff reforms across the world, and with other provinces implementing ST; (iv) provision of 
information and training at different institutional levels and through agencies, especially the ones 

in direct contact with users; (v) carrying out of research and studies aimed at better understanding 

energy consumption patterns in vulnerable households and potential sources for energy efficiency 
improvements, including the potential implementation of efficiency measures; and (vi) carrying 
out of communication and education campaigns for electricity users.
