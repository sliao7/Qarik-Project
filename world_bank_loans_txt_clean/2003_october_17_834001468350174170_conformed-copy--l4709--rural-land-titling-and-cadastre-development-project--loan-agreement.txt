such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount 

outstanding in any Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 
the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or 

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts.
