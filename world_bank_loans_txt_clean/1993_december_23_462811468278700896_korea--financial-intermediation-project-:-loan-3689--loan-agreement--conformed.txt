ment, provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of para-

graph 2 (b) of Schedule 1 to the respective Project Agreements to

which the respective Participating Banks are parties, payments for
expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of free-limit Sub-

Such expenditures, however, shall qualify as eligible expenditures

only if the Bank shall subsequently authorize such withdrawals; and

Special Account for each of Categories (3)(a), (3)(b) and (3)(c)
included in the eligible Categories, an amount equivalent to

$3,000,000 and, for each of Categories (1) and (2) included in the

from the Loan Account and deposited into the respective Special
Accounts pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of this Schedule.

2. Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this

Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that

each Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the

Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the

Special Account sha'Ll be made as follows:
(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a

deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the

Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account

and deposit into the relevant Special Account such amount or amounts

as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of each Special Account, the

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for

amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-

drawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall

follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the

Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to

the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such

amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Accounts as of the date

Single Currency LIBOR Determination

1. Single Currency LIBOR for any Interest Period shall be the

offered rate for deposits in dollars for a period of six months which

appears on the display designated as page "3750" on the Telerate

monitor (or such other page or service as may replace it for the

purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks

for dollar deposits), as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second

day on which banks and foreign exchange markets are open for business

in London prior to the relevant January 15 or July 15 (the Interest

Determination Date).

2. If such rate does not appear on the Telerate monitor or on such

service as may replace it, the Bank shall request the London offices

of four major banks to provide the Bank with the rate at which

deposits in dollars are offered by such banks on the Interest Deter-

mination Date to leading banks in the London interbank market for a

period of six months ending on the last day of such Interest Period.

Single Currency LIBOR for such Interest Period shall be the arith-

metic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the fifth decimal place)

of such offered quotations as determined by the Bank.

3. If not more than one major bank provides the Bank with such

quotations under paragraph 2 above, Single Currency LIBOR 
shall be

the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the fifth

decimal place) determined by the Bank of the rates quoted by at least

two major banks in New York City selected by the Bank on the Interest

Determination Date for loans in dollars to leading European banks for

a period of six months ending on the last day of such Interest

Period. If fewer than two of the banks so selected are quoting such

rates, Single Currency LIBOR shall be the single currency in effect

for the last preceding Interest Period.
