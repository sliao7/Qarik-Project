describing a program of actions, objectives and policies designed to achieve 
structural adjustment of the Borrower’s social sector (hereinafter called the

requesting assistance from the Bank in support of the Program during the execution 
thereof; and 

      (B) on the basis, inter alia, of the foregoing, the Bank has decided in 
support of the Program to provide such assistance to the Borrower by making the Loan 
as hereinafter provided;

      NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

      Section 2.02. (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the proceeds of the Loan from the 
Loan Account in support of the Program.

      (b) The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank the first

Account.

      (c) The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used 
to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan 
shall have been used to make a payment for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment; or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, 
refund such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall 
be credited to the Loan Account for cancellation. 

      Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be December 31, 1997, or such later date as 
the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later 
date.

      Section 2.04. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment charge at the rate 
of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per annum on the principal amount of the 
Loan not withdrawn from time to time. 

      Section 2.05. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a rate for each Interest Period 
equal to LIBOR Base Rate plus LIBOR Total Spread.

      (b) For the purpose of this Section:

             (i)  “Interest Period” means the initial period from and
                  including the date of this Agreement to, but excluding, the
                  first Interest Payment Date occurring thereafter and, after
                  the initial period, each period from and including an
                  Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next following
                  Interest Payment date.

     (ii)  “Interest Payment Date” means any date specified in Section
                  2.06 of this Agreement.

           (iii)  “LIBOR Base Rate” means, for each Interest Period, the
                  London interbank offered rate for six-month deposits in
                  Dollars for value the first day of such Interest Period (or,
                  in the case of the initial Period, for value the Interest
                  Payment Date occurring on or next preceding the first day of
                  such Interest Period), as reasonably determined by the Bank
                  and expressed as a percentage per annum.

            (iv)  “LIBOR  Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: (A)
                  one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%); (B) minus (or plus) the
                  weighted average margin, for such Interest Period, below (or
                  above) the London interbank offered rates, or other
                  reference rates, for six-month deposits, in respect of the 
                  Bank’s outstanding borrowings or portions thereof allocated 
                  by the Bank to fund single currency loans or portions 
                  thereof made by it that include the Loan; as reasonably 
                  determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage per 
                  annum.

(c) The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate and LIBOR Total 
Spread for each Interest Period, promptly upon the determination thereof.

      (d) Whenever, in the light of changes in market practice affecting the 
determination of the interest rates referred to in this Section 2.05, the Bank 
determines that it is in the interest of its borrowers as a whole and of the Bank to 
apply a basis for determining the interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as 
provided in said Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest 
rates applicable to the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower 
of the new basis. The basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice period 
unless the Borrower notifies the Bank during said period of its objection thereto, in 
which case said modification shall not apply to the Loan.

      Section 2.06. Interest and other charges shall be payable May 15 and November 15 
in each year.

Bank for its review and comment a report on the progress achieved in carrying out the 
Program, in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request.

      (c) Without limitation upon the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section,
