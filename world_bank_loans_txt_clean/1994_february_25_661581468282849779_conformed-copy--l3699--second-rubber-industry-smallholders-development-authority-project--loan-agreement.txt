                            SCHEDULE 2

                     Description of the Project

      The objectives of the Project are to increase the productivity
and efficiency of the rubber smallholder subsector, to improve the
institutional effectiveness of RISDA, and to help develop human
resources and the private sector in rural areas.

      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to
time to achieve such objectives:

Part A:     Crop Development

1.    Replanting with rubber, oil palm and other crops of about 90,000
hectares of areas previously under rubber.

2.    Improving the quality of rubber planting materials, by consolida-
tion of the nursery sites and training RISDA, ESPEK and cooperatives
nursery staff in planting material production and management.

3.    Maintaining during immaturity the areas to be replanted under the
Project and about 200,000 hectares previously replanted (excluding
cocoa).

4.    Rehabilitating  failed replantings, and replantings with
unsatisfactory field conditions, due to events beyond the control of
smallholders, on about 5,000 hectares.

Part B:     Infrastructure Development

      Upgrading and maintaining about 1,000 kilometers of agricultural
access roads, including bridges and drainage works, to support the
replanting program.

Part C:     Extension and Smallholder Training

1.    Providing equipment and materials for RISDA’s extension program
to improve RISDA’s capacity to provide extension services directed
towards increasing productivity of mature rubber to smallholders and
hired tappers.

2.    Providing agricultural training for smallholders with particular
emphasis on women smallholders and workers.

Part D:     Applied Research

      Completion of the following studies:

      (a)   study of the responsiveness of various rubber clones to
stimulation with LITS;

      (b)   study for the development of physiological/biochemical
parameters as early warning indicators of stress in rubber trees under
stimulation;

      (c)   study of the nutritional aspect in relation to LITS;

      (d)   survey of the performance of Class II clones on progressive
smallholdings; and

      (e)   research on mixed cropping systems using rubber with fruit
trees.

Part E:     Mini-Estates Development and Improvement

1.    Providing loans to meet supplementary development costs of
replanting on mini-estates established prior to the Project and not yet
in production (to cover items such as terracing, drainage, development
of vacant pocket areas, internal roads and perimeter fencing).

2.    Establishing a pilot program for the introduction of LITS, intro-
ducing LITS to mini-estates which face tapper shortages, and providing
training related to LITS for tappers and for RISDA staff.

3.    Improving the mini-estates database and the monitoring system for
mini-estate performance.

4.    Assisting the transfer of management of mini-estates to coopera-
tives through management and business administration training of RISDA,
NARSCO and cooperatives staff.

Part F:     Strengthening and Rationalization of Cooperatives

1.    Developing and implementing a plan for the rationalization and
restructuring of cooperatives.

2.    Strengthening management and business administration capacities
of cooperatives through training for RISDA, NARSCO and cooperatives
staff and Board members and through the provision of technical
assistance.

Part G:     Institutional Development

1.    Providing computer equipment and software and training and tech-
nical assistance to further develop RISDA’s computerized management
information systems.

2.    Providing overseas training to RISDA staff.

3.    Providing equipment and materials and technical assistance to
develop and implement a human resource management system in RISDA and
to strengthen the graphics capability of RISDA’s communication unit.

4.    Establishing a training management course for RISDA’s training
unit staff and directors of RISDA’s training institutes.

5.    Studying the agricultural performance of RISDA’s replanting and
extension programs in immature rubber areas.

      The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1996.
