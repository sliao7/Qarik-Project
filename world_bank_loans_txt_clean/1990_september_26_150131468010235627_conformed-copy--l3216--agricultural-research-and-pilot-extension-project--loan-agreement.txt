2. Strengthening the training capabilities of the staff of the CFVAs, in order to 
train field extension staff in each Wilaya; 

3. Acquisition of vehicles, and extension and audio-visual equipment, and 
construction and/or rehabilitation of certain CNPA, CFVA and Wilayat training 
buildings, all as required for the provision of extension services under Part B of the
