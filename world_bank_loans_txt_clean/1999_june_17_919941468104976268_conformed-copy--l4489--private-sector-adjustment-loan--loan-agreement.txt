hundred million Dollars ($300,000,000). 

Section 2.02. (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of 
this Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the proceeds of the Loan from 
the Loan Account in support of the Program. 

(b) The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank the first 
request for withdrawal from the Loan Account, and thereafter maintain in its central 
bank, a deposit account in Dollars on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. 
All withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit 
Account. 

(c) The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used 
to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan 
shall have been used to make a payment for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment, or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, 
refund such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall 
be credited to the Loan Account for cancellation.

this Agreement based on evidence satisfactory to the Bank: (A) with the progress 
achieved by the Borrower in the carrying out of Program; (B) that the macroeconomic 
policy framework of the Borrower is consistent with the objectives of the Program; and 
(C) that the actions described in Schedule 3 to this Agreement have been taken, in 
form and substance satisfactory to the Bank. If, after said exchange of views, the 
Bank shall have given notice to the Borrower that the progress achieved and actions 
taken are not satisfactory, or that the macroeconomic framework is not consistent with 
the objectives of the Program, and, within 90 days after such notice, the Borrower 
shall not have achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the Bank, or the 
macroeconomic framework has not become consistent with the objectives of the Program, 
as the case may be, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan or any part thereof. 

Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be March 31, 2000, or such later date as 
the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later 
date. 

Section 2.04. On or promptly after the Effective Date, the Borrower shall pay to 
the Bank a fee in an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the amount of the Loan.

of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per annum on the principal amount of the 
Loan not withdrawn from time to time.  

Section 2.06. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a rate for each Interest Period 
equal to LIBOR Base Rate plus LIBOR Total Spread.

(b) For the purposes of this Section: 

(i) “Interest Period” means the initial period from and including the 
date of this Agreement to, but excluding, the first Interest Payment Date 
occurring thereafter, and after the initial period, each period 
from and including an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the 
next following Interest Payment Date. 

(ii) “Interest Payment Date” means any date specified in Section 2.07 
of this Agreement. 

(iii) “LIBOR Base Rate” means, for each Interest Period, the London 
interbank offered rate for six-month deposits in Dollars for 
value the first day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of the 
initial Interest Period, for value the Interest Payment Date occurring 
on or next preceding the first day of such Interest Period), as 
reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage 
per annum.

(iv) “LIBOR Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: (A) 
three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%); (B) minus (or plus) the 
weighted average margin, for such Interest Period, below (or above) 
the London interbank offered rates, or other reference rates, for 
six-month deposits, in respect of the Bank’s outstanding borrowings or 
portions thereof allocated by the Bank to fund single currency loans 
or portions thereof made by it that include the Loan; as reasonably 

determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage per annum. 

(c) The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate and LIBOR Total 
Spread for each Interest Period, promptly upon the determination thereof. 

(d) Whenever, in light of changes in market practice affecting the

that it is in the interest of its borrowers as a whole and of the Bank to apply a 
basis for determining the interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as provided 
in said Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest rates 
applicable to the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower of 
the new basis. The basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice period 
unless the Borrower notifies the Bank during said period of its objection thereto, in 

which case said modification shall not apply to the Loan.
