cost the equivalent of $100,000 or more, the procedures set forth in 
paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. 

. (b) With respect to each contract not governed by the

Section II. Employment of Consultants 

l. In order to assist the Borrower in the carrying out the 
Project, the Borrower shall employ consultants whose qualifications, 
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be 
satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in 

accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank 
on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World 
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published 
by the Bank in August 1981. For complex, time-based assignments, the 
Borrower shall employ such consultants under contracts using the 
standard form of contract for consultants’ services issued by the 
Bank, with such modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank. 
Where no relevant standard contract documents have been issued by 
the Bank, the Borrower shall use other standard forms agreed with 
the Bank.

the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank 
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, 

letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts 
shall not apply to contracts estimated to cost less than $50,000 
equivalent each. However, this exception to prior Bank review shall 
not apply to the terms of reference for such contracts nor to the 
employment of individuals, to single source selection of firms, to 
assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the 
Bank and to amendments of contracts raising the contract value to 
$50,000 equivalent or above.
SCHEDULE 5 

Special Account 

1. For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1), (2) 

and (3) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement ; 

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in 
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for 
the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan 
allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance 
with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 

(c) the term “Authorized Allocation" means an amount 

equivalent to $1,600,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and 

deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of 
this Schedule. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively 
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this 
Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that 
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the 
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a 
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan 

Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 
deposits into the Special Account at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, 
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the 

~ 24 - 

documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment 
or payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into 
the Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested and as shall have been 
shown by said documents and other evidence to 
have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall 
be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account 
under the respective eligible Categories, and in 
the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have 
been justified by said documents and other 

evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special 
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall 

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 

expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 

into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all 

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the 
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 

Agreement; or 

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated 

to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding 
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal 
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories 
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such 
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure 
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 

deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 

Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 

(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account 

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General 

Conditions.
