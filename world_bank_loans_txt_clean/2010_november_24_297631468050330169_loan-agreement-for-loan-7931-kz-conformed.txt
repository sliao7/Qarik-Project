Section III.  Modifications to the Anti-Corruption Guidelines 

The modifications to the Anti-Corruption Guidelines are as follows:   

1.  Section 5 is re-numbered as Section 5(a) and a new Section 5(b) is added to read as 

follows: 

“… (b)  These Guidelines also provide for the sanctions and related actions to be imposed by the 

Bank on Borrowers (other than the Member Country) and all other individuals or entities 

who are recipients of Loan proceeds, in the event that the Borrower or the individual or 

entity has been debarred by another financier as a result of a determination by such 

financier that the Borrower or the individual or entity has engaged in fraudulent, corrupt, 

coercive or collusive practices in connection with the use of the proceeds of a financing 

made by such financier.” 

2. Section 11(a) is modified to read as follows: 

“… (a)  sanction in accordance with prevailing Bank’s sanctions policies and procedures (fn13) a 

Borrower (other than a Member Country) (fn 14) or an individual or entity, including (but 

not limited to) declaring such Borrower, individual or entity ineligible publicly, either 

indefinitely or for a stated period of time: (i) to be awarded a Bank-financed contract; (ii) 

to benefit from a Bank-financed contract, financially or otherwise, for example as a sub-

contractor; and (iii) to otherwise participate in the preparation or implementation of the 

project or any other project financed, in whole or in part, by the Bank, if at any time the 

Bank determines (fn 15) that such Borrower, individual or entity has engaged in corrupt, 

fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in connection with the use of loan 

proceeds, or if another financier with which the Bank has entered into an agreement for 

the mutual enforcement of debarment decisions has declared such person or entity 

ineligible to receive proceeds of financings made by such financier or otherwise to 

participate in the preparation or implementation of any project financed in whole or in 

part by such financier as a result of a determination by such financier that the Borrower 

or the individual or entity has engaged in fraudulent, corrupt, coercive or collusive 

practices in connection with the use of the proceeds of a financing made by such 

financier.” 

Footnotes: 

“13. An individual or entity may be declared ineligible to be awarded a Bank financed contract 

upon completion of sanctions proceedings pursuant to the  Bank’s sanctions policies and 

procedures, or under the procedures of temporary suspension or early temporary suspension in 

connection with an ongoing sanctions proceeding, or following a sanction by another financier 

with whom the Bank has entered into a cross debarment agreement, as a result of a determination 

by such financier that the firm or individual has engaged in fraudulent, corrupt, coercive or 

collusive practices in connection with the use of the proceeds of a financing made by such 

financier.”
“14. Member Country includes officials and employees of the national government or of any of its 

political or administrative subdivisions, and government owned enterprises and agencies that are 

not eligible to bid under paragraph 1.8(b) of the Procurement Guidelines or participate under 

paragraph 1.11(c) of the Consultant Guidelines.” 

“15. The Bank has established a Sanctions Board, and related procedures, for the purpose of 

making such determinations. The procedures of the Sanctions Board sets forth the full set of 

sanctions available to the Bank. In addition, the Bank has adopted an internal protocol outlining 

the process to be followed in implementing debarments by other financiers, and explaining how 

cross-debarments will be posted on the Bank’s website and otherwise be made known to staff and 

other stakeholders.”
