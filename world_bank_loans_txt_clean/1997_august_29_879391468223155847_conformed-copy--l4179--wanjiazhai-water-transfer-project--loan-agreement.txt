A. Wanjiazhai Dam Safety

In order to ensure the safety of the Wanjiazhai Dam and downstream life, 
property and activities, the Borrower shall, through its Ministry of Water Resources, 
take the following actions.

1. Operation and Maintenance and Emergency Preparedness Plans

The Borrower shall prepare, on the basis of guidelines acceptable to the Bank, 
and furnish to the Bank not later than December 31, 1998, a plan for the operation and 
maintenance of the Wanjiazhai Dam and an emergency preparedness plan for said dam, 
afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange views with the Borrower on said 
plans, and thereafter implement the same with due diligence and efficiency, taking 
into account the views of the Bank on the matter.

2. Periodic Inspections

The Borrower shall ensure that inspections of the Wanjiazhai Dam and of its 
operation and maintenance shall be undertaken, annually for the first five years 
following its completion, and thereafter, at intervals of not more than three years, 
all in accordance with sound engineering practices and on the basis of guidelines 
acceptable to the Bank, by qualified and experienced independent experts, in order to 
identify any deficiencies in the condition of the Wanjiazhai Dam or in the quality and 
adequacy of the maintenance or methods of operation of said dam or of its plan for 
emergency preparedness, which may endanger the safety of said dam or of downstream 
life, property or activities, and to rectify any such deficiencies promptly.  To this 
end, the Borrower shall employ not later than October 31, 1998, a panel of independent 
experts whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference shall be acceptable to 
the Bank, to be responsible for undertaking such periodic inspections of the 

Wanjiazhai Dam.  The Borrower shall ensure that said panel shall prepare and furnish 
to the Borrower and the Bank, promptly upon completion of each said inspection, a 
report on the results of said inspection, together with any measures recommended to be 
taken to ensure the safety of the Wanjiazhai Dam and downstream life, property and 
activities.  The Borrower shall afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange 
views with the Borrower on each report furnished by said panel and shall thereafter 
implement the measures recommended by said report, taking into account the views of 
the Bank on the matter.

B. Wanjiazhai Dam Resettlement

1. The Borrower shall take, and shall cause to be taken all measures necessary to 
ensure that all persons displaced as a result of the construction of the Wanjiazhai 
Dam shall be resettled in accordance with the Resettlement Action Plan so as to 
improve the living standards and productivity of all such persons.

2. The Borrower shall maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to 
monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators satisfactory 
to the Bank, the implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan and the achievement of 
its objectives.  The Borrower shall prepare, under guidelines satisfactory to the 
Bank, and furnish to the Bank semiannual reports not later than April 15 and October 
15 of each Fiscal Year, integrating the results of said monitoring and evaluation 
activities performed during the preceding calendar semester and setting out the 
measures recommended to ensure the continued efficient implementation of the 
Resettlement Action Plan and achievement of its objectives during the following twelve 
month period, including any proposed revisions to said plan indicated by said 
monitoring and evaluation activities.  The Borrower shall afford the Bank a reasonable 
opportunity to exchange views with the Borrower on each said report and shall 
thereafter implement the recommendations and introduce the revisions proposed in said 
report, taking into account the views of the Bank on the matter.

3. To give effect to Sections 1 and 2 of this Part B, the Borrower shall employ, 
not later than February 15, 1998, independent experts whose qualifications, experience 
and terms of reference shall be acceptable to the Bank, to be responsible for

on the socioeconomic development of persons displaced as a result of the construction 
of the Wanjiazhai Dam, and for preparation of the reports referred to above in Section

SCHEDULE 5

Special Account

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a) the term “eligible Categories” means Categories (1), (2), (3), (4) and 
(5);

(b) the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c) the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount equivalent to 
$15,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special 
Account pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless 
the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 
amount equivalent to $9,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the 
Loan plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed 
the equivalent of $100,000,000.

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 

withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account 
at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 
have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents 
and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special 
Account for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be 
withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible 

Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been 
justified by said documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower 
shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and Section 
2.02(a) of this Agreement;

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the 
period of time specified in Section 4.01(b)(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit 
reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals 
from the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General 
Conditions; or

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the 
Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be 
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished 
to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account 
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 

of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall 
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, 
as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
