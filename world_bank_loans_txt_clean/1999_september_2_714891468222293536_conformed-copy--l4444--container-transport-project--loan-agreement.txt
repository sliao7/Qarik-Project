additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the respective 
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal 
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. 
Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into any Special 
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.

expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts.
