Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works
 
Part A: International Competitive Bidding
 
1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and civil works shall be procured 
under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth 
in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA 
Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines).

(a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid referred to in paragraph 
2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, when contract award is delayed beyond the 
original bid validity period, the successful bidder’s bid price will be increased for 
each week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one 
to be applied to all foreign currency components and the other to the local currency 
component of the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in the 
bid evaluation.

(b) In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part A, the Borrower 
shall use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such 
modifications thereto as the Bankshall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of 
the Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the 
Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based on other internationally 
recognized standard forms agreed with the Bank. 

2. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped into bid 
packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $250,000 or more.

Part B: Preference for Regional Manufacturers

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 
A hereof, a margin of preference may be granted to bids offering goods described in 
the accompanying specification which are manufactured to a substantial extent in any 
country, including Costa Rica, which is a party to the Mercado Comen Centroamericano, 
the common market created by the General Treaty for Central American Economic 
Integration signed at Managua, Nicaragua on December 13, 1960 by Guatemala, El 
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica (hereinafter called the CACM), in 
accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions:

1. For the purposes of Part B of this Schedule, the following definition shall 
apply:

(a) (i) the term "Qualified CACM Bid" means a bid submitted by a 
manufacturer established in the territories of member countries, 
including Costa Rica, of the CACM, for goods manufactured or processed 
in such territories and for which the bidders shall have 
established to the satisfaction of the entity or agency inviting bids 
that the manufacturing or processing cost of such goods include a 
value added in such territories equal to at least 20% of the 
ex-factory bid price of such goods;

(ii) the term "non-Qualified CACM Bid" means a bid submitted by a 
manufacturer established in the territories of member countries, 
including Costa Rica, of the CACM, for goods manufactured or processed 
in such territories, other than any such bid classified as a Qualified 
CACM Bid; and

(iii) the term "Foreign Bid" means any bid which is neither a Qualified 
CACM Bid or a Non-Qualified CACM Bid.
 
2. All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly indicate any 
preference which would be granted and shall set forth the information required to 
establish the eligibility of a bid for such preference.

3. Bidders are required to state in their bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price of 
imported goods and the ex-factory price of locally manufactured goods.

4. Except to the extent hereinafter provided, bids will be compared on the basis of 
their ex-factory or c.i.f. (port of entry) price adjusted in accordance with 
paragraphs 2.49 through 2.54 of the Guidelines.

5. After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one or the following 
groups: Qualified CACM Bids, Non-qualified CACM Bids or Foreign Bids.

6. All bids in each group will be first compared among themselves, to determine the 
lowest evaluated bid in each such group. The lowest evaluated bids of each group will 
then be compared with each other and if, as a result of this comparison, an evaluated 
Qualified CACM Bid or Non-Qualified CACM Bid is the lowest it will be selected for 
purpose of award.

7. If the lowest bid in the comparison under paragraph 6 above is a Foreign Bid, 
all Foreign Bids will be further compared with the lowest evaluated Qualified CACM Bid 
as determined under paragraph 6 above. For the purposes of this comparison only, each 
Foreign Bid will be compared on the basis of the sum of its c.i.f. (port of entry) 
price adjusted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 above, plus an amount 
equal to the smaller of: (a) the difference between the amount of customs duties and 
other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the importation 
of goods offered in such Foreign Bid and that applicable to a Qualified CACM Bid; or 
(b) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods. If the Qualified CACM Bid is the lowest 
evaluated bid in such comparison, it shall be selected for the purpose of award; 
otherwise, the lowest evaluated Foreign Bid as determined under paragraph 6 above 
shall be so selected.

expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the 
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have 
requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 
have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the 
respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall

eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts

shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall 
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, 
as the case may be.

in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
