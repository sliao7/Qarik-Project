awarded a Bank-financed contract shall be as defined under Section I of
the Procurement Guidelines; accordingly, no bidder or potential bidder
shall be declared ineligible for contracts financed by the Bank for reasons
other than those provided in Section I of the Procurement Guidelines.

(b) Registration of Contractors and Suppliers: Registration shall not be used
to assess bidders' qualifications. A foreign bidder shall not be required to
register as a condition for submitting its bid, and a foreign bidder
recommended for contract award shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to register, with the reasonable cooperation of the Borrower, prior to

(c) Participation of Joint Ventures: Participation of Joint Ventures shall be
allowed and all its members shall be jointly and severally liable for the

(d) Bidding Documents: Bidding documents acceptable to the Bank shall be
used, and shall be prepared so as to ensure economy, efficiency,
transparency, and broad consistency with the provisions of Section I of the
Procurement Guidelines.

(e) Qualification: Qualification criteria shall be clearly specified in the
bidding documents. All criteria so specified, and only such specified
criteria, shall be used to determine whether a bidder is qualified.
Qualification shall be assessed on a "pass or fail" basis, and merit points
shall not be used. Such assessment shall be based entirely upon the
bidder's or prospective bidder's capability and resources to effectively
perform the contract, taking into account objective and measurable factors,
including: (i) relevant general and specific experience, and satisfactory
past performance and successful completion of similar contracts over a
given period; (ii) financial position; and where relevant, (iii) capability of
construction and/or manufacturing facilities. Prequalification procedures
and documents acceptable to the Bank shall be used for large, complex
and/or specialized works. The verification of the information upon which
a bidder was prequalified, including current commitments, shall be carried
out at the time of contract award, along with the bidder's capability with
respect to personnel and equipment. In the procurement of goods and
works where pre-qualification is not used, the qualification of the bidder
who is recommended for award of contract shall be assessed by post-
qualification, applying the qualification criteria stated in the bidding
documents.

(f) Cost Estimate: The detailed cost estimates shall be confidential and shall
not be disclosed to prospective bidders. The cost estimate will include all
taxes including Value Added Tax (VAT). No bids shall be rejected on the
basis of comparison with the cost estimates without the Bank's prior
written concurrence.

(g) Bid Submission and Bid Opening: Prospective bidders shall be given at
least thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the invitation to bid
or the date of availability of the bidding documents, whichever is later, to
prepare and submit bids. Bids shall be opened in public, immediately after
the deadline for submission of bids. Bids received after the deadline for
bid submission shall be rejected and returned to bidders unopened. A copy
of the bid opening minutes shall be promptly provided to all bidders who
submitted bids, and to the Bank with respect to contracts subject to the
Bank's prior review.

(h) Bid Evaluation: Evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the
evaluation criteria specified in the bidding documents. Evaluation criteria
other than price shall be quantified in monetary terms. Merit points shall
not be used, and no minimum point or percentage value shall be assigned
to the significance of price, in bid evaluation. Contracts shall be awarded
to the qualified bidder whose bid has been determined: (i) to be
substantially responsive to the bidding documents; and (ii) to offer the
lowest-evaluated cost. No negotiations shall be permitted. A bidder shall
not be required, as a condition for award, to undertake obligations not
specified in the bidding documents or otherwise to modify the bid as
originally submitted. A bidder shall not be eliminated from detailed
evaluation on the basis of minor, non-substantial deviations.

(i) Rejection of All Bids and Re-bidding: All bids (or the sole bid if only one
bid is received) shall not be rejected, the procurement process shall not be
cancelled, and new bids shall not be solicited without the Bank's prior
written concurrence.

(j) Bid Validity: The bid validity period required by the bidding documents
shall be sufficient to account for any period that may be required for the
approval and registration of the contract as contemplated in the PPL. If

justified by exceptional circumstances, an extension of bid validity may
be requested in writing from all bidders before the original bid validity
expiration date, provided that such extension shall cover only the
minimum period required to complete the evaluation, award a contract,
and/or complete the registration process, but not more than thirty (30)
days; a corresponding extension of any bid guarantee also shall be required
in such cases. A Bidder may refuse the request for extension of bid validity
without forfeiting its bid guarantee. No further extensions shall be
requested without the prior written concurrence of the Bank.
(k) Guarantees: Guarantees shall be in the format included in the bidding
documents. The bid guarantee shall be valid for twenty-eight days (28)
beyond the original validity period of the bid, or beyond any period of
extension if requested. No advance payments shall be made without a
suitable advance payment guarantee. Performance security shall not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the contract amount.

(1) Fraud and Corruption: The bidding documents and contract as deemed
acceptable by the Bank shall include provisions stating the Bank's policy
to sanction firms or individuals, found to have engaged in fraud and
corruption as defined in the Procurement Guidelines.

(in) Inspection and Audit Rights: Each bidding document and contract
financed out of the proceeds of the Financing shall provide that bidders,
suppliers and contractors, and their subcontractors, agents, personnel,
consultants, service providers, or suppliers, shall permit the Bank to
inspect all accounts, records, and other documents relating to the
submission of bids and contract performance, and to have them audited by
auditors appointed by the Bank. Acts intended to materially impede the
exercise of the Bank's inspection and audit rights provided for in the
Procurement Guidelines constitute an obstructive practice as defined in the
Guidelines.

(n) Contract Modifications: With respect to contracts subject to the Bank's
prior review, the Borrower shall obtain the Bank's no objection before
agreeing to: (i) a material extension of the stipulated time for performance
of a contract; (ii) any substantial modification of the scope of services or
other significant changes to the terms and conditions of the contract;
(iii) any variation order or amendment (except in cases of extreme
urgency) which, singly or combined with all variation orders or
amendments previously issued, increases the original contract amount by

SCHEDULE 3

Amortization Schedule

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal
Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such
repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

On each April 1 and October 1

Beginning October 1, 2022 1.72%

through October 1, 2050

On April 1, 2051 1.96%

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn
Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this
Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.
3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal
Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each
such amount.
