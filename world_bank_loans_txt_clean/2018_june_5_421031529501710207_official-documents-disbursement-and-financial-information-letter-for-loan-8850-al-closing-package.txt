Re: IBRD Loan No. 8850- AL
(Regional and Local Roads Connectivity Project)

Additional Instructions: Disbursement and Financial Information Letter (DFIL)

Excellency:

I refer to the Loan Agreements ("Agreements") between the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (the "Bank"), and Republic of Albania (the "Borrower") for the above-referenced Project.
The General Conditions, as defined in the Loan Agreement, provide that the Borrower may from time to
time request withdrawals of Loan Amounts from the Loan Account in accordance with the Disbursement
and Financial Information Letter, and such additional instructions as the Bank may specify from time to
time by notice to the Borrower. The General Conditions also provide that the Disbursement and Financial
Information Letter may specify Project specific financial reporting requirements.

I. Disbursement Arrangements, Withdrawal and Reporting of Loan Proceeds

The Disbursement Guidelines for Investment Project Financing, dated February 2017,
("Disbursement Guidelines") are available in the Bank's public website at https://www.worldbank.org and
its secure website "Client Connection" at https://clientconnection.worldbank.or . The Disbursement
Guidelines are an integral part of this DFIL, and the manner in which the provisions in the Disbursement
Guidelines apply to the Loans is specified below.

(i) Disbursement Arrangements

* Instructions (Schedule 1). The table provides the disbursement methods which may be used by the
Borrower, information on registration of authorized signatures, processing of withdrawal
applications (including minimum value of applications and processing of advances), instructions
on supporting documentation, and frequency of reporting on the Designated Account.

* Disbursement Deadline Date, DDD (subsection 3.7). The DDD is four (4) months after the Closing
Date. Any changes to this date will be notified by the Bank.

(ii) Electronic Delivery. Refer to section 10.01 (c) of the General Conditions.

The Bank may permit the Borrower to electronically deliver applications (with supporting documents)
through the Bank's web-based portal (https://clientconnection.worldbank.org) "Client Connection". This
option may be effected if the officials designated in writing by the Borrower who are authorized to sign and
deliver Applications have registered as users of "Client Connection". The designated officials may deliver
Applications electronically by completing the Form 2380, which is accessible through "Client Connection".
By signing the Authorized Signatory Letter, the Borrower confirms that it is authorizing such persons

to accept Secure Identification Credentials (SIDC) and to deliver the Applications and supporting

documents to the Bank by electronic means. The Borrower may continue to exercise the option of
preparing and delivering Applications in paper form. The Bank reserves the right and may, in its sole
discretion, temporarily or permanently disallow the electronic delivery of Applications by the Borrower.
By designating officials to use SIDC and by choosing to deliver the Applications electronically, the
Borrower confirms through the authorized signatory letter its agreement to: (a) abide by the Terms and
Conditions of Use of Secure Identification Credentials in connection with Use of Electronic Means to
Process Applications and Supporting Documentation, available in the Bank's public website at
https://worldbank.org and "Client Connection"; and (b) to cause such official to abide by those terms and
conditions.

II. Financial Reports and Audits

(i) Financial Reports. The Borrower shall prepare and furnish to the Bank not later than forty-five (45)
days after the end of each calendar quarter, interim unaudited financial reports ("IFR") for the Project
covering the quarter.

(ii) Audits. The Borrower shall have the Project's Financial Statements audited in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5.09(b) of the General Conditions. Each audit shall cover the period of one fiscal
year of the Borrower. For each such period, the audited Financial Statements for the Project shall be (a)
furnished to the Bank not later than six (6) months after the end of such period; and (b) made publicly
available in a timely fashion and in a manner acceptable to the Bank.

III. Other Information

available on the Bank's public website and "Client Connection". The Bank recommends that you register
