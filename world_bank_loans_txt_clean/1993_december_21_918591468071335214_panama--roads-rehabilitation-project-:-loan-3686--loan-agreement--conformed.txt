Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower
