(a) the term "eligible Category" means the Category in the 
table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; 

(b) the term “eligible expenditures" means expenditures in 
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for 
the Project and to be financed out of the Loan allocated from time 
to time to the eligible Category in accordance with the provisions 
of Schedule 1 to this Agreement, provided, however, that 

notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 (b) of Schedule 4 to 
this Agreement, payments for expenditures to be financed by free- 

limit Sub-loans may be made out of the Special Account before the 
Bank shall have authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account in 
respect thereof. Such expenditures, however, shall qualify as 
eligible expenditures only if the Bank shall subsequently authorize 
such withdrawals; and 

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount 

equivalent to $3,500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and 

deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of 
this Schedule. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively 

for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this 
Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that 
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the 
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a 
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan 

Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested.
(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 
deposits into the Special Account at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents 
and other evidence required pursuant to para- 
graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 

payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 

from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 
have requested and as shall have been shown by 
said documents and other evidence to have been 
paid out of the Special Account for eligible 
expenditures. 

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan 
Account under the respective eligible Category, and in the 
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special 
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall 

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 
into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that ail 

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the 
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement; or 

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated 

to the eligible Category for the Project, less the amount of any 
outstanding special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to 
Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, 
shall equal the equivalent cf twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the 

remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Category for the Project shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals 
shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have 
been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the 
Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in 
making payments for eligible expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure 
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 

the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 
Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 

(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited te the Loan Account 

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
