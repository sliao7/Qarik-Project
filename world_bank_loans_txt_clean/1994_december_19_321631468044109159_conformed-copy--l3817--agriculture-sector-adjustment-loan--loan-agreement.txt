                                 Procurement

1.  Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of $5,000,000 or more each shall be awarded through
international competitive bidding in accordance with procedures
consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines), subject to the
following modifications:

    (a)   Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the following
is substituted therefor:

    "2.8 Notification and Advertising

          The international community should be notified in a timely
    manner of the opportunity to bid. This will be done by
    advertising invitations to apply for inclusion in a bidder’s
    invitation list, to apply for prequalification, or to bid; such
    advertisements should be placed in at least one newspaper of
    general circulation in the Borrower’s country and, in addition,
    in at least one of the following forms:

          (i)   a notice in the United Nations publication,
                Development Forum, Business Edition; or

         (ii)   an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or
                technical journal of wide international circulation;
                or

        (iii)   a notice to local representatives of countries and
                territories referred to in the Guidelines, that are
                potential suppliers of the goods required."

    (b)  The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of
the Guidelines:

          "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require the
    bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely used in
    international trade and specified in the bidding documents."

(c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.

    (d)   When contract award is delayed beyond the original bid
validity period, such period may be extended once, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.59 of the Guidelines,
by the minimum amount of time required to complete the evaluation,
obtain necessary approvals and clearances and award the contract. The
bid validity period may be extended a second time only if the bidding
documents or the request for extension shall provide for appropriate
adjustments of the bid price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs
for the contract over the period of extension. Such an increase in
the bid price shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation.

    (e)   In the procurement of goods in accordance with this
paragraph 1, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding
documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the
Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the
Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been
issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based
on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the
Bank.

2.  Procurement of pesticides shall be consistent with guidelines
for use and selection of pesticides agreed with the Bank.

3.  Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of less than $5,000,000 shall be awarded:

    (a)   by purchasers required to follow the Borrower’s public
procurement procedures for the importation of goods, on the basis of
such procedures, provided that such procedures shall have been found
acceptable by the Bank; and

    (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with established
commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be awarded
on the basis of evaluation and comparison of quotations obtained from
suppliers from at least two countries, except that direct contracting
procedures acceptable to the Bank may be used where considered
appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines.

4.  Subject to the prior approval of the Bank, commonly traded
commodities may be procured through organized international commodity
markets or other channels of competitive procurement acceptable to
the Bank, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.

5.  With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 1 of
this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the
submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of
funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract, two
conformed copies of such contract, together with the analysis of the
respective bids and recommendations for award, a description of the
advertising and tendering procedures followed and such other
information as the Bank shall reasonably request.

6.  With respect to each contract referred to in paragraphs 3
and 4 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior
to the submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal
of funds from the Loan Account in respect thereof, such documentation
and information as the Bank may reasonably request to support
withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.

7.  The provisions of the preceding paragraph 6 of this Schedule
shall not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals from the
Loan Account are to be made on the basis of statements of
expenditure.
