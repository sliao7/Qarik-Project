Amortization Schedule

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Non-Concessional
Portion of the Loan and the percentage of the total principal amount of the Non-
Concessional Portion of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date ("Installment
Share"). If the proceeds of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Non-
Concessional Portion of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment
Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) the Withdrawn Balance of the
Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the
Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted,
as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which
a Currency Conversion applies.

(Expressed as a Percentage)

On each May 15 and November 15
Beginning November 15, 2021 1.67%

On May 15, 2051 1.47%

2. If the proceeds of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn
as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Non-Concessional
Portion of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be
determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan have
been withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay
the Withdrawn Balance of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan as of such
date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original
Installment Share") and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion
applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Non-Concessional Portion of the Loan withdrawn within two
calendar months prior to any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely
of calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be
treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment
Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of
withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.
