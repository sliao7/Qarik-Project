(“Borrower”) and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND 
DEVELOPMENT (“Bank”) for the purpose of providing financing in support of the Program (as 
defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).  The Bank has decided to provide this financing on 
the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions which the Borrower has already taken under the Program 
and which are described in Section I. A of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower’s 
maintenance of an appropriate macro-economic policy framework.  The Borrower and the Bank 
therefore hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I — GENERAL CONDITIONS; DEFINITIONS 
 
1.01. The General Conditions (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement) constitute an 

integral part of this Agreement. 
 
1.02. Unless the context requires otherwise, the capitalized terms used in this Agreement have

ARTICLE II — LOAN 

2.01. The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions set forth or referred 

to in this Agreement, the amount of sixty five million Dollars ($65,000,000), as such 
amount may be converted from time to time through a Currency Conversion in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this Agreement (“Loan”). 

2.02. The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program in 

accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

(0.25%) of the Loan amount. The Borrower shall pay the Front-end Fee not later than 
sixty days after the Effective Date. 

2.04. The interest payable by the Borrower for each Interest Period shall be at a rate equal to 

LIBOR for the Loan Currency plus the Fixed Spread; provided, that upon a Conversion 
of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, the interest payable by the 
Borrower during the Conversion Period on such amount shall be determined in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of Article IV of the General Conditions.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance remains 
unpaid when due and such non-payment continues for a period of thirty days, then the 
interest payable by the Borrower shall instead be calculated as provided in Section 3.02 
(d) of the General Conditions. 

2.05. The Payment Dates are April 15 and October 15 in each year.
2.06 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this Section, the principal

Withdrawal of an amount of such Unwithdrawn Loan Balance does not exceed 
18 years from the Maturity Fixing Date and the final maturity of such 
Withdrawal does not exceed 30 years from the Maturity Fixing Date (or such 
other average maturity and/or final maturity as may be generally applicable to 
loans made by the Bank to the Borrower at the time of such agreement); and (ii) 
such repayment provisions have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank 
prior to the Withdrawal Date of any such Withdrawal. 

2.07. (a) The Borrower may at any time request any of the following Conversions of the 

terms of the Loan in order to facilitate prudent debt management: (i) a change of 
the Loan Currency of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Loan, 
withdrawn or unwithdrawn, to an Approved Currency; (ii) a change of the 
interest rate basis applicable to all or any portion of the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from a Variable Rate to a Fixed Rate, or vice 
versa; and (iii) the setting of limits on the Variable Rate applicable to all or any 
portion of the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding by the 
establishment of an Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate Collar on the Variable 
Rate. 

(b) Any conversion requested pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section that is 

accepted by the Bank shall be considered a “Conversion”, as defined in the 
General Conditions, and shall be effected in accordance with the provisions of 
Article IV of the General Conditions and of the Conversion Guidelines.  

2.08. Amounts of the Withdrawn Balance that have been repaid or prepaid in accordance with 

this Loan Agreement prior to the Closing Date shall be re-credited to the Loan Account 
and be made available for further withdrawal by the Borrower. In the event that any 
amount prepaid has been converted under a Currency Conversion, the amount re-credited 
to the Loan Account shall be denominated in the original Loan Currency and equal to the 
amount prior to such Conversion. 

2.09. Without limitation upon the provisions of Section 5.10 of the General Conditions, the 

Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Bank such information relating to the provisions

(c) without limitation upon the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section,

result of a Natural Disaster. 

2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the receipt by the Bank of a request 

for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, the Bank determines that a review of the 
Borrower’s progress in carrying out the Program is warranted, the Bank shall give notice 
to the Borrower to that effect.  Upon the giving of such notice, no withdrawals shall be

Bank shall reasonably request.
G. Excluded Expenditures. The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall 
not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines at any time that an 
amount of the Loan was used to make a payment for an Excluded Expenditure, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund an amount equal to the 
amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request 
shall be cancelled.
