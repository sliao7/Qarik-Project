SCHEDULE 6

Special Account

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a) the term “eligible Categories” means Categories (1), (2) and (3) set 
forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

(b) the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the carrying out of the Project and 
to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan; and

(c) the term “Authorized Allocations” means: (i) the amount of $7,000,000 to 
be withdrawn from the Dollar Tranche in the Loan Account and deposited into the Dollar 
Special Account; and (ii) the amount DEM 12,700,000 to be withdrawn from the Deutsche 
Mark Tranche in the Loan Account and deposited into the DEM Special Account, all 
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocations shall be limited to the amount of 
$3,500,000 and the amount of DEM 6,300,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals 
from the Dollar Tranche and the Deutsche Mark Tranche, respectively, plus the total 
amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to 
Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed $12,000,000 with 
respect to the Dollar Tranche and DEM 24,500,000 with respect to the Deutsche Mark 
Tranche.

2. Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that a Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocations, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Dollar or the DEM Special 
Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Authorized Allocation for said Special Account.  On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the relevant Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower 
shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Dollar or DEM Special Account, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits 

into such Special Account at such intervals as the Bank shall 
specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence 

required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of 
each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Dollar or DEM 
Special Account, as the case may be, such amount as the Borrower shall 
have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents 

and other evidence to have been paid out of the relevant 
Special Account for eligible expenditures.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Dollar or the DEM Special 
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, 
furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was 
made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Accounts:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the 
period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit 
reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 

the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Accounts;

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals 
from the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General 
Conditions; or

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan, minus the total amount of 
all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 
of the General Conditions shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocations. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify 
by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to 
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on 
deposit in the Special Accounts as of the date of such notice will be utilized in 
making payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Dollar or the DEM Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not 
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the 
evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit 
into the relevant Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the 
Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so 
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by 
the Bank into the Special Accounts shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the Dollar or the DEM Special Account will not be required to cover further 
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
