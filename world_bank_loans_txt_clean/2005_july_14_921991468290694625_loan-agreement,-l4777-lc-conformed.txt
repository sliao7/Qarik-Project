the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal

by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

 (b) If the Bank determines at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special Account will not be required to cover payments for Eligible Expenditures during 
the six-month period following such determination, the Borrower shall, promptly upon 
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

 (a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish

Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant to Part B.3 of Schedule 1 to 
this Agreement for the payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount as 
the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the

SCHEDULE 2 

Description of the Project 

The objective of the Project is to assist the Participating Countries in improving 
public access to and the quality and use of telecommunications and information and 
communications technology (ICT) services, in support of socio-economic development 
among the Participating Countries. 

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof 
as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objective: 

Part A: Legal and Regulatory Reforms

Provision of technical assistance to ECTEL and the Participating Countries’ 
National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) to:  

1. strengthen national and regional regulatory frameworks to promote competition 
in the telecommunications and ICT services sector;  

2 establish a regional forum to build consensus and facilitate resolution of 
commercial and public policy issues related telecommunications and ICT services;  

3.  establish guidelines and a standard model for alternative dispute resolution 
facilities;  

4.  develop costing methodology and policies and procedures to determine 
interconnection and related consumer rates, and explore methods to attract additional 
service providers to enter the telecommunications market; and  

5.  conduct a comprehensive review of the telecommunications legislation, focusing 
on interconnection and spectrum management and implementation of numbering and 
dispute resolution procedures (this includes the provision of a comprehensive regional 
program of related training to the staff of ECTEL and NTRC and government staff of the 
Participating Countries). 

Part B: Universal Access

1. Establishment of universal service guidelines (USG) for the management and 
implementation of a universal service fund (USF), including: (a) reviewing existing 
telecommunications legislation and regulations relating to universal access; and (b)

conducting regional consultations to seek consensus in Participating Countries on the 
implementation of the USF. 

2. Provision of technical assistance to ECTEL and NTRCs to adapt the USG within 
each Participating Country for the management and implementation of the USF. 

3. Implementation of a USF designed to improve public access to 
telecommunications infrastructure and broadband connectivity, through the financing of 
specific projects which promote private investment in broadband connectivity and 
advanced ICT access infrastructure for under-served communities and public institutions. 
 
Part C: Information and Communication Technologies

1. Expansion of broadband applications used by Participating Countries and the 
private sector through: (a) identification of policies required for facilitating the 
development of broadband applications and infrastructure, and drafting of appropriate 
regulations to implement such policies; (b) recommendation of a common information 
systems architecture, information technology standards for the Participating Countries, 
and a viable mechanism by which complex information systems may be supported and 
maintained; and (c) design of pilot projects that encourage regional use of broadband 
technologies. 

2.  Implementation of up to five ICT pilot projects that demonstrate the viability and 
business case for ICT and the application of ICT using broadband connectivity, with 
focus on regional initiatives. 

3. Establishment of an alternative telecommunications system to transfer data from 
the radio spectrum monitoring system to ECTEL and the five NTRCs through the use of 
alternative technology.  

Part D: Project Management

Strengthening the capacity of ECTEL staff in priority technical areas and project 
management, including the provision of technical assistance in procurement and financial 
management, and the conducting of auditing activities for the Project.
