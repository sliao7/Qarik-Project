provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals 
made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is

denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate 
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the 
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if 
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

“‘Conversion Date’ means, in respect of a Conversion, the Execution Date 
(as herein defined) or such other date as requested by the Borrower and 
accepted by the Bank, on which the Conversion enters into effect, and as 
further specified in the Conversion Guidelines.” 

(b) The definition of the term “Variable Rate” is modified, in relevant part, to 

read as follows: 

“(c) upon a Currency Conversion to an Approved Currency of an 
amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance that accrues interest at a variable 
rate during the Conversion Period, the variable rate of interest applicable 
to such amount shall be equal to either: (i) the sum of: (A) LIBOR,  or 
such other base rate as may be agreed by the Borrower and the Bank, for 
the Approved Currency; plus (B) the spread to LIBOR or to such other 
base rate, if any, payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge 
Transaction relating to said Currency Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the interest rate 
component of the Screen Rate.”
