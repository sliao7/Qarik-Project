Annex 
to

SCHEDULE 5

Project Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators

1. During each year of Project implementation, district heating charges are established and 
maintained at levels which: (a) allow each Participating District Heating Enterprise to cover all 
prudently incurred costs of operations, including local costs of the Sub-project and a reasonable 
level of profitability; (b) fully cover depreciation on revalued assets.  During each year of Project 
implementation, the transfers from the Participating Cities to the Participating District Heating 
Enterprises take into account amounts not invoiced by the Participating District Heating 
Enterprise to its household customers.

2. The percentage of full cost recovery district heating charges paid by households in each 
Participating City are not less than 80% in year 2001, 90% in year 2002, and 100% in year 2003 
and thereafter. 

3. The average collection ratio in the communal heating sector of the Participating Cities 
(i.e., the ratio of collected operating revenues to total billings) increase from a minimum level of 
seventy percent (70%) in year 2000 to seventy five percent (75%) in year 2001, eighty percent 
(80%) in year 2002, eighty five percent (85%) in year 2003, and ninety five percent (95%) in 
year 2004.

4. The average cash collection ratio in the communal heating sector of the Participating 
Cities (i.e., the cash collection ratio of cash collections to total collected operating revenues) 
increase to at least sixty percent (60%) in year 2001, seventy percent (70%) in year 2002, eighty 
five percent (85%) in year 2003, and one hundred percent (100%) in year 2004 and thereafter.

5. At the completion of the Project, quality of heat and hot water services has increased 
significantly, and the energy efficiency of the Participating District Heating Enterprise has 
improved significantly compared to base-line figures prior to Project implementation.

6. By the time of Project completion, the operating costs of the Participating District 
Heating Enterprises have decreased, in comparable inflation-adjusted prices and under 
comparable conditions, and such cost decrease will be reflected in the related district heating 
charges.

7. During the Project, the Participating Cities will significantly improve targeting of 
heating subsidies to the low-income households, as a part of their housing allowance programs or 
successor programs.

8. At the completion of the Project, funds spent by each Participating City to support 
municipal heating services (including operating losses of the Participating District heating 
Enterprises and subsidies with respect to the heating costs of low income households) will 
decrease, in comparable inflation-adjusted prices and under comparable conditions.

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to $4,000,000 to 
be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to 
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,

aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding 
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of $7,000,000.

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures 
in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been 
duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish 
the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts which 
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request 
or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and 
deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account at such intervals 
as the Bank shall specify.

documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower shall, 
at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall not be 
required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals 
should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance with the 
provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement;

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period of time 
specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts

Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal 
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.  

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the 
Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify 
by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent 
that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special 
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as 
the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so 
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into 
the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding 
amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any portion 
of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
