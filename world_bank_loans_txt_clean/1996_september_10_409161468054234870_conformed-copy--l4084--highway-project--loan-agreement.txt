request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit into the respective Special Account
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

     (b)  (i)  For replenishment of the respective Special Account, the
               Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits
               into the respective Special Account at such intervals as

               shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence
               required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the
               payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is

of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

     (d)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to
the eligible Categories for the respective Special Account minus the
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with
respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the
amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the
Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as
the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further with-
drawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit into
the respective Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment
out of the any Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an
amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii)
was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional
evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the respective
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof
not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no
further deposit by the Bank into any Special Account shall be made until
the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund,
as the case may be.

     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in any Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.

     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank
all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Accounts.

     (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
