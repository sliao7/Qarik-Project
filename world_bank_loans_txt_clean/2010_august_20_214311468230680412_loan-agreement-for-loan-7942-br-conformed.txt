2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 

the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the 
Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 
of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original 
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar weeks prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for 
each such amount.

Currency in effect at 12:01 a.m. Washington D.C. time, one calendar day

Adjustment for such Withdrawal; provided that: (a) for the purposes of
determining the Default Interest Rate, pursuant to Section 3.02(d), that is 
applicable to an amount of the Withdrawn Loan Balance on which 
interest is payable at a Fixed Rate, the "Fixed Spread" means the Fixed 
Spread, as modified by the Basis Swap Adjustment, that was applicable

Variable Spread, as modified by the Basis Swap Adjustment for such 
Withdrawal; as reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a 
percentage per annum. In the case of a loan denominated in more than 
one Currency, "Variable Spread" applies separately to each of the 
Currencies. 

(h)  A new term "Basis Swap Adjustment" is added as follows: "Basis Swap 

Adjustment" means, for each Withdrawal, the adjustment (whether by a 
positive or negative number) that results from a basis swap transaction 
executed by the Bank to swap the London interbank offered rate for six 
month deposits into the London interbank offered rate for one month 
deposits, as reasonably determined by the Bank on the Withdrawal Date.  

(i) The term "LIBOR" is modified to read as follows: "LIBOR" means, for 

any Interest Period, the London interbank offered rate for one-month 
deposits in the Loan Currency, expressed as a percentage per annum, that 
appears on the Relevant Telerate Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on 
the LIBOR Reset Date for the Interest Period. If such rate does not 
appear on the Relevant Telerate Page, the Bank shall request the 
principal London office of each of four major banks to provide a 
quotation of the rate at which it offers one-month deposits in the Loan 
Currency to leading banks in the London interbank market at
