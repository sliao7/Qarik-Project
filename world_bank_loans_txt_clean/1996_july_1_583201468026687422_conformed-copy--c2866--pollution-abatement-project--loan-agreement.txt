Participating Agreements to be entered into between the Borrower and
each such Participating Bank on terms and conditions which shall have
been approved by the Bank and which shall include those set forth in

or proposed to be financed by the Borrower or the Participating Banks
out of the proceeds of the Loan and the proceeds of the Credit; provided,
however, that such aggregate amount may be increased to the equivalent
of $8,000,000 in cases where the Steering Committee, referred to in
Section 3.01 (a) of the Guarantee Agreement, determines, and the Bank
agrees, that such an increase is required to finance urgent industrial
pollution abatement investments to reduce high levels of toxic
substances or heavy metals emissions in densely populated areas.

4.    The Borrower shall exercise its rights under the Subsidiary
Participating Agreements in such manner as to protect its interests
and the interests of the Bank and to achieve the purposes of the
Project, and, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, not assign,
amend, abrogate or waive any such Agreement.

5.    The Borrower shall coordinate and monitor the overall execution
of the Project, the carrying out by the Participating Banks of their
obligations pursuant to their respective Subsidiary Participating
Agreement and the carrying out by Beneficiaries of their obligations
pursuant to their respective agreements with NBE and the Participating
Banks providing for Sub-loans, in accordance with policies and pro-
cedures satisfactory to the Bank.

                            SCHEDULE 6

                          Special Account

1.    For the purposes of this Schedule:

      (a)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of amounts paid by the Borrower on account of Sub-loans to
be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

      (b)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equi-
valent to $2,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of
this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall other-
wise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount
equivalent to $1,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals
from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equi-
valent of $6,000,000.

2.    Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule.

3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the
Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account
shall be made as follows:

      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the
Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such
request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount
or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

      (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower
                  shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into
                  the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank
                  shall specify.

           (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                  Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and
                  other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of
                  this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect
                  of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of
                  each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                  Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
                  into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                  shall have requested and as shall have been shown by
                  said documents and other evidence to have been paid
                  out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account
in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by
said documents and other evidence.

4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account,
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request,
furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such
payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the
Special Account:

      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

      (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,
within the period of time specified in Section 4.02 (a) (ii) of this
Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the
Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records
and accounts for the Special Account;

      (c)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

      (d)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan, minus the
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with
respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall
specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be
made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satis-
fied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account
as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for
eligible expenditures.

6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or
in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or
(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank)
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof
not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or
refund, as the case may be.

      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover
further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.

      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
