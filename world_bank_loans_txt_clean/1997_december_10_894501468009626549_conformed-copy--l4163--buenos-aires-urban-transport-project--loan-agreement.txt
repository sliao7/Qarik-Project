portions of their track without deviating from the original existing track bed, 
renovating their electric substations and electric transmission systems, installing 
automatic signals and an operations control center for the lines, improving their 
passenger stations (such as by installing or rebuilding escalators), improving their 
mechanical workshops, ventilation systems and drainage systems and reconstructing 
approximately eight Urquiza line electric coaches.

2. Rehabilitation (including civil works supervision) of Buenos Aires subway system 
line A by completely replacing its track without deviating from the original existing 
track bed, installing three new electric substations for the line, renewing the line’s 
power transmission system, renovating its signal and communications system, expanding 
the subway operations control center to include control of the line, replacing the 
line’s drainage pumps and ventilation system, installing or rebuilding its station 
escalators and merging its existing Lima and Piedras stations so as to improve 
passenger transfer conditions between Buenos Aires subway system lines A and C.

facilities by carrying out Integration Subprojects (consisting of, e.g., building or 
improving bus terminals, transfer centers and car parks) at selected major AMBA subway 
and/or rail stations.

2. (a) Minor improvements (such as, e.g., installation of bus-only lanes and other 
traffic flow enhancements, traffic signals, walkways, sidewalks and bicycle parking 
facilities) at outlying AMBA subway and/or rail stations, so as to ease bus, car, 
pedestrian and bicycle access to such stations; and (b) carrying out of a promotional 
campaign to encourage bicycle access to such stations.

Part C: Traffic Safety Enhancement and Environmental Monitoring

1. (a) Conversion (including civil works supervision) of approximately twelve grade 
road/rail crossings in the AMBA into non-grade road/rail crossings, at or near the 
same sites as the original grade crossings (by carrying out Traffic Safety Subprojects 
involving tunnel or bridge construction); (b) installation or rehabilitation of 
automatic barriers at the sites of selected road/rail crossings in the AMBA that will 
not be converted to non-grade crossings; (c) carrying out of a study to develop a 
comprehensive strategy to improve the safety of road/rail grade crossings in the AMBA; 
and (d) implementation of other traffic safety measures in the AMBA (such as 
implementation of a traffic safety public education campaign).

2. Installation and operation of an air quality and noise pollution monitoring 
system for the city of Buenos Aires.

Part D: Institutional Strengthening

1. Carrying out of an integrated urban transport study for the AMBA, which study 
shall include a transport survey and, on the basis of the results of said survey, 
subsequent preparation of a transport model suitable for quantitatively assessing the 
feasibility and comparative merits of alternative transportation strategies for the 
AMBA.

2. Development of an AMBA traffic and street environment improvement program.

3. Provision of technical assistance to ST on:  (a) technical, financial, 
environmental and social aspects of urban transport in general, as well as on the 
preparation, appraisal and carrying out of Integration Subprojects and Traffic Safety 
Subprojects in particular; and (b) general Project administration.

in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to 
$10,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the Special 
Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless 
the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 
amount equivalent to $2,000,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the 
Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or 
exceed the equivalent of $25,000,000.

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested.

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account 
at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested.  On the 
basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the

Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested 
and as shall have been shown by said documents and other evidence 

to have been paid out of the Special Account for eligible

from the Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, 
and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been 
justified by said documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the Borrower 
shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further

the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Accounts;

Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the 
Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be 
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account:  (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence 
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:  (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the 
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal 
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  
Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special 
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of

cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
