successfully perform the contract, which shall be verified through post-

from bidding. If a registration process is required, a foreign bidder declared 
the lowest evaluated bidder shall be given a reasonable opportunity to

daily newspaper. Invitations could be also advertised on the web sites of the

law and are not a dependent agency of the contracting authority. Furthermore, they will

(f) Bidding Documents 

Procuring entities shall use the appropriate standard bidding documents 
acceptable to the Bank for procurement of goods and works. 
 
(g) Bid Opening, Bid Evaluation and Contract Award 

� Bids shall be submitted in a single envelope containing the bidder’s 
qualification information, technical and price bids, which shall be opened 
simultaneously at the public bid opening. 

� No bids shall be rejected at the bid opening except for late bids and bids shall 

not be evaluated as part of bid opening process. 
 
� The economic, financial and technical capacity of the bidders cannot be

appropriate price adjustment clause.  
 
(j) Securities 
 
� Bid security and performance security should follow the generally accepted 

practice used in the local market.  
 
� Alternative methods such as bid securing declaration may be acceptable, in 

which case the Borrower may require bidders to sign a declaration accepting that 
if they withdraw or modify their bids during the period of validity or they are 
awarded the contract and they fail to sign the contract or to submit a performance 
security before the deadline defined in the bidding documents, the bidder will be 
suspended for bidding in any contract with the implementing unit. 

� No advance payment shall be made to contractors without a suitable advance 

payment security. These securities shall be included in the bidding documents in 
a text and format acceptable to the Bank.

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date 
Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 

On each March 15and September 15 
 Beginning September 15, 2018  
 through September 15, 2034 

2.94% 

On March 15, 2035 2.98% 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 
in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment 
Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable 
to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 
 
3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 

payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable 
on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  
 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 
on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 
immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate. 
 
5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
