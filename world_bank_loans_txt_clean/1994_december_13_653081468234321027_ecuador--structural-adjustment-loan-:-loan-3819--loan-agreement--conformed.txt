SCHEDULE 4

l. Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the 
equivalent of $5,000,000 or more each shall be awarded through 
international competitive bidding in accordance with procedures 
consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the 
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines), and in 

accordance with the following additional procedures: 

(a) Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the 
following is substituted therefor: 

"2.8 Notification and Advertising 

The international community should be notified in a 
timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This will be done by 
advertising invitations to apply for inclusion in a bidder's 
invitation list, to apply for prequalification, or to bid; 
such advertisements should be placed in at least one newspaper 
of general circulation in the Borrower's country and, in 
addition, in at least one of the following forms: 

(i) a notice in the United Nations publication, 

Development Forum, Business Edition; or 

(ii) an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or 
technical journal of wide international 
circulation; or 

(iii) a notice to local representatives of countries 
and territories referred to in the Guidelines, 

that are potential suppliers of the goods 
required." 

(b) The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of 
the Guidelines: 

"As a further alternative, bidding documents may require 
the bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely 
used in international trade and specified in the bidding 
documents."
(c) Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted. 

(d) When contract award is delayed beyond the original bid 

validity period, such period may be extended once, subject to and in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.59 of the Guidelines, 
by the minimum amount of time required to complete the evaluation, 
obtain necessary approvals and clearances and award the contract. 
The bid validity period may be extended a second time only if the 
bidding documents or the request for extension shall provide for 
appropriate adjustment of the bid price to reflect changes in the 
cost of inputs for the contract over the period of extension. Such 
an increase in the bid price shall not be taken into account in the 
bid evaluation. 

(e) In the procurement of goods in accordance with this 
paragraph 1, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding 
documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the 
Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the 
Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been 
issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based 
on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the 
Bank. 

2. Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the 
equivalent of less than $5,000,000 shall be awarded: 

(a) by purchasers required to follow the Borrower's public 
procurement procedures for the importation of goods, on the basis of 
such procedures, provided that such procedures shall have been found 
acceptable by the Bank; and 

(b) by other purchasers, in accordance with established 
commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be awarded 
on the basis of evaluation comparison of quotations obtained from 
suppliers from at least two countries, except that direct 
contracting procedures acceptable to the Bank may be used where 
considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines. 

3. Subject to the prior approval of the Bank, commonly traded 
commodities may be procured through organized international 
commodity markets or other channels of competitive procurement 
acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with procedures acceptable to 
the Bank.
4. With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 1 of 
this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the
