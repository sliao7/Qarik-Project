Account and deposited into the Special Account 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Annex, provided, 
however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, 
the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 
amount equal to $2,500,000, the aggregate amount of

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized 
Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a 
request or requests for deposit into the Special 
Account of an amount or amounts which in the aggregate 
do not exceed the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis 
of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit 
into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested.

(b) For replenishment of the Special Account, 
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for

for the payment or payments in respect of which 
replenishment is requested.  On the basis of each such

withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 
Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said 
documents and other evidence to have been paid out of 
the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures. Each 
such deposit into the Special Account shall be 
withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under one

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan minus the total amount 
of all outstanding special commitments entered into by 
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, 
withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such 
procedures, as the Bank shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
