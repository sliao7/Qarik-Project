                                SCHEDULE 5

                         Implementation Program

Parts A and B of the Project

1.   Part A of the Project will be carried out by COFIDE in accordance
with the provisions of the Project Agreement with the assistance and
under the supervision of the Borrower, through its Ministry of Economy
and Finance in coordination with the PCU, as set forth below.

2.   The Borrower, through the PCU, shall approve the Selected
Irrigation Projects on the basis of: (a) feasibility studies and;
(b) evidence that the WUOs in question are willing and able to repay
the Sub-Subloans. The PCU shall also approve all firms to be employed
by WUOs for the supervision of the rehabilitation of Selected
Irrigation Projects.

3.   In order to ensure that WUOs are maintaining the Selected
Irrigation Projects in an adequate and sustainable manner and are
receiving an appropriate water charge for the recovery of their
operations and maintenance cost, the Borrower, through the PCU,
shall employ an independent technical auditor to monitor the status
of operation and maintenance of the Selected Irrigation Projects on
an on-going basis.  Said auditor will be charged with reviewing the
irrigation infrastructure of the Selected Irrigation Projects every
three years and to recommend corrective actions if necessary.  The
Borrower, through the PCU, shall ensure that WUOs comply with such
recommendations within one year of the date of the technical
auditor’s report.

4.   Part B of the Project will be carried out by consultants under
the supervision of the PCU.

Part C of the Project:

Part C.1

5.   The training to be provided to the extension workers shall
include extensive coverage of all know-how necessary for transferring
irrigation and drainage knowledge to irrigation system users. It
shall include training on environmental aspects, particularly with
respect to the use of agrochemicals and mitigation of their
environmental impact. 
6.   Extension workers will be hired directly by WUOs or other
farmers’ organizations selected between the PCU and the Bank. As a

condition of their employment and training, extension workers will
be required to sign a commitment to work with the hiring WUO or
farmer organization for a minimum of five years, or to repay the
salary they received during their training.

7.   In addition to extension work in irrigation and drainage,
extension workers will be responsible for disseminating the matching
grant program to be carried out under Part C.2 of the Project to all
farmers able to participate in the program and for assisting poorer
farmers in participating in the program.

8.   In areas where irrigation systems were rehabilitated under Part
A of the Project, such irrigation systems will be used by the
extension workers to promote the adoption of modern irrigation
technology and to encourage farmers to use more efficient irrigation
systems and techniques.

9.   The Borrower, through the PCU, shall ensure that all consultants
employed by WUOs under Part C.1 of the Project shall be employed
under standard terms and conditions and standard terms of reference
approved by the Bank.

Part C.2

10.  A matching grant program for the adoption of new irrigation
technology will be carried out by the Borrower, through the PCU for
the benefit of all farmers, WUOs and other farmer organizations
interested in modernizing their practices in order to achieve more
efficient use of water and soil resources. To ensure that all
possible beneficiaries are provided equal opportunity of access to
the subsidies program, available program funds will be allocated
to each of the main irrigated areas on the Pacific coast on the
basis of hectarage under irrigation. In addition, in order to
promote poverty alleviation, the program will provide no more
than 80% subsidy to farmers with less than 15 hectares and a
subsidy of no more than 50% to farmers with more than 15 hectares.

11.  Only irrigation projects on land with water already supplied
to the farm site will be eligible to receive matching grants under
the program.

12.  The matching grant will be paid on the cost of studies to
establish improved irrigation methods and on the cost of equipment
needed to apply irrigation water and agricultural chemicals
(including the necessary pumping equipment in cases where
pressurization is needed) and the PCU shall maintain proof of
payment of all studies and equipment on account of which it has
made matching grants.

13.  Irrigation projects will not be eligible for the matching grant
program if:

     (a)  investment costs per hectare exceed the equivalent of
$5,000; and

     (b)  investment costs exceed $150,000 equivalent for projects
financed by individual farmers or $300,000 equivalent for projects
financed by WUOs or other farmer organizations.

14.  Matching grants will be awarded for eligible projects on the
basis of a competitive selection process organized by the PCU. The
rules for this selection process as well as all other procedures

Part E of the Project

15.  Part E of the Project will be supervised by a dam safety
supervision committee established within INADE on the basis of
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. Day-to-day management
of the dam safety emergency program will be assured by a unit to
be established within INADE with staffing, functions and

organization acceptable to the Bank.

16.  The Borrower, through INADE, shall at all times operate and
maintain the Selected Dams, and shall make all necessary repairs
and renewals thereof, in accordance with sound engineering,
irrigation, environmental, ecological and financial practices.

17.  Without limitation on the generality of paragraph 16 above,
the Borrower, through INADE, shall under arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank, cause the Selected Dams, after their rehabilitation
under Part E of the Project, to be periodically inspected in
accordance with sound engineering practice in order to determine
whether there are any deficiencies in the condition of such
structures, or in the quality and adequacy of maintenance or
methods of operation of the same, which may endanger their safety.
To this end, the Borrower, through INADE, shall propose to the
Bank appropriate arrangements for the Bank’s review no later than
one year before the expected completion date of the rehabilitation
of each of such structures.
