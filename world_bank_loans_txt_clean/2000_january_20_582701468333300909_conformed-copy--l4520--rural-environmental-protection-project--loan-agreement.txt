The term “Authorized Allocations” means: (a) the amount of $150,000 to be 
withdrawn from the USD Tranche in the Loan Account and deposited into the USD Special 
Account; and (b) the amount of EUR 130,000 to be withdrawn from the EUR Tranche in the 
Loan Account and deposited into the EUR Special Account, pursuant to paragraph 2 of 
this Annex; provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, the 
Authorized Allocation shall be limited to the amount of $100,000 and the amount of EUR 
90,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the USD Tranche and the EUR 
Tranche, respectively, plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments 
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall 
equal or exceed the equivalent of $300,000 with respect to the USD Tranche and EUR 
260,000 with respect to the EUR Tranche.

2. Withdrawals of the Authorized Allocations and subsequent withdrawals to 
replenish the Special Accounts shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocations, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the USD or the EUR Special Account 
of an amount or amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed the Authorized Allocation 
for said Special Account. On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf 
of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the relevant Special 
Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) For replenishment of the USD or the EUR Special Account, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposit into such Special Account at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify. Prior to or at the time of each such request, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to Part B.3 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement for the payment or payments in respect of 
which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, 
on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the USD or 
the EUR Special Account, as the case may be, such amount as the Borrower shall have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and other evidence to have 
been paid out of the relevant Special Account for Eligible Expenditures. Each such 
deposit into a Special Account shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account 
under one or more of the Eligible Categories.

3. The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special 
Accounts, once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan minus the total amount of all 
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of 
the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 

Authorized Allocations. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify 
by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to 
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on 
deposit in the Special Accounts as of the date of such notice will be utilized in 
making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

Loan Account under one or more of the relevant Special Account’s Eligible Categories. 

2. Each application for withdrawal from the USD Tranche or the EUR Tranche in the 
Loan Account for deposit into the relevant Special Account shall be supported by a 
Project Management Report.

3. Upon receipt of each application for withdrawal of an amount of the USD Tranche 
or the EUR Tranche of the Loan, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the relevant Special Account an amount equal to 
the lesser of: (a) the amount so requested; and (b) the amount which the Bank has 
determined, based on the Project Management Report accompanying said application, is 
required to be deposited in order to finance Eligible Expenditures during the 
six-month period following the date of such report; provided, however, that the amount 
so deposited, when added to the amount indicated by said Project Management Report to 
be remaining in the relevant Special Account, shall not exceed the equivalent of 
$300,000 with respect to the USD Tranche and EUR 260,000 with respect to the EUR
