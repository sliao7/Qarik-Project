Management Plan then in effect, or in respect of the excess of the 

recoveries receivable by TCIP under Reinsurance Transactions as a 
result of the occurrence of such Covered Risk, or both, in 
any case as in effect as at the date of such application, together with 
an indication of the relevant amount in each such case; (b) with

payment of  such part of Eligible Claims which, under 
Reinsurance Transactions, remains the obligation of TCIP; and 

(vi) on the basis of the Borrower’s announcement referred to in Section 
4 of this Schedule 6 and on the basis of the reports filed by its loss 
adjusters, settle promptly all Eligible Claims in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in the Earthquake Insurance Policies. 

(l) maintain records of all Earthquake Insurance Policies issued, all loss

best reasonable estimate of the extent of the losses suffered by residential dwellings 
as a result thereof, as well as confirm whether such losses will be within the 
financial resources of, and available to, TCIP at the relevant date (including 
accumulated premium reserves and investment income, recoveries under Reinsurance 
Transactions and any unwithdrawn amount in the Loan Account), in which case Eligible 
Claims will be paid by TCIP in full, or whether such losses exceed such financial 
resources, in which case Eligible Claims will be prorated accordingly.

5. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 5, the 
Borrower shall, for the purposes of financing claims under the National Catastrophic 
Insurance Program, if deemed to be justified by the Bank under the circumstances 

existing at the time, be entitled to withdraw on the Closing Date the balance, if any, 
in the Loan Account allocated at that time to Category (5) in the table in Schedule 1 
to this Agreement on such Date, subject to the following provisions: 

(a) no later than by November 30, 2004, the Borrower shall have provided the 
Bank with written confirmation of its intention to withdraw, on the Closing Date, the 
entire balance so remaining unwithdrawn in the Loan Account for the purposes of 
financing such claims by supplementing the financial reserves then established by TCIP 
for such purposes; and 

(b)   no withdrawal of such balance remaining shall be made unless the Bank 
is satisfied with the progress achieved by TCIP in the implementation of the National 
Catastrophic Insurance Program and an agreement is reached among the Bank, the 
Borrower and TCIP as to the use of such proceeds.

6. (i)  Other than for the purposes of paragraph 5 of this Schedule 6 
above, if the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 
disbursement out of the Loan Account: (a) was made other than to 
permit TCIP to pay Eligible Claims; or (b) was not justified by the 
evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice 
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may 
request; or (B) refund to the Bank an amount equal to the amount of 
such amount withdrawn deposit from the Loan Account or the portion thereof 

not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no 
further disbursement by the Bank from the Loan Account shall be made 

until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or 
refund, as the case may be. 

(ii) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to the above paragraph 6(i) 
shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent 
withdrawal or cancellation in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
