Procurement and Consultants’ Services 

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works 

Part A: International Competitive Bidding 

1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be procured under 
contracts awarded iii accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in 
Sections I aiid II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines). 

(a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid referred to in paragraph 
2.13 of thie Guidelines shall provide that, when contract award is delayed beyond the 
original bid validity period, the successful bidder’s bid price will be increased for each 
week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be 
applied to all foreign currency components and the other to the local currency component 
of the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. 

(b) In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with this Part A, 
the Borrower shall use or cause to be used the relevant standard bidding documents issued 
by the Bank for the use of its borrowers, with such modifications thereto as the Bank 
shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Project. Where no relevant 

standard bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use or 
cause to be used bidding documents based on other internationally recognized standard 
forms agreed with the Bank. 

2. Bidders for the supply of dust control systems for the Subproject to be carried out 
by Nova Era under Part A(a) of the Project shall be prequalified as provided in paragraph 

2.10 of the Guidelines. 

Part B: Preferencé for Domestic Manufacturers 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 
A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in 
accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions: 

1. All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly indicate any 
preference which would be granted, the information required to establish the eligibility
of a bid for such preference, and the methods and stages that will be followed in the 
evaluation and comparison of bids. 

2. After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the following two 
groups: 

68) Group_A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the 
bidder shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower 
and the Bank that such goods contain components manufactured 
in Brazil equal to at ieast 50% of the value of the complete 
goods. 

(2) Group B: bids offering any other goods. 

3. In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, all evaluated bids 
in each group shall first be compared among themselves, without taking into account 
customs duties and other import taxes levied in connection with the importation, or the 
sales and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of the goods pursuant 
to the bids. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be compared with each other, and if, 

as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for 
the award. 

4. If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the lowest evaluated 
bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared with the lowest 
evaluated bid from group A after adding: (a) to the evaluated bid price of goods to be 
imported in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (ij) the amount of 

customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay 
for the importation of the goods offered in such group B bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid 
price of such goods; and (b) to the evaluated bid price of goods supplied domestically 
offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the amount of customs 
duties and other import taxes which would be levied on the goods offered in such group 
B if they originated from the same foreign country as the bid included in group B which 
enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import taxes, or (ii) 15% of the ex-factory bid 
price of such goods. If, as a result of this comparison, the bid from group A is the lowest, 
it shall be selected for the award; if not, the lowest evaluated bid from group B, as 

determined under paragraph 3 above, shall be selected for the award. 

Part C: Other Procurement Procedures 

I. Works estimated to cost the equivalent of $5,000,000 or less per contract, up to 
an aggregate amount equivalent to $16,100,000, and goods estimated to cost less than the
equivalent of $300,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to $4,900,000, 
may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised

pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the 
first payment out of the Special Account in respect of such contract.

that can be quantified objectively, and the procedure for such quantification shall be 
disclosed in the invitation to bid.

goods (and related services) without any change in the unit prices or other terms and 
conditions of sale.
Section I]. Employment of Consultants
