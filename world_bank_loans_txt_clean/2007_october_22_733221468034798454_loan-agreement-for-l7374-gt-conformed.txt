Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal

with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved
