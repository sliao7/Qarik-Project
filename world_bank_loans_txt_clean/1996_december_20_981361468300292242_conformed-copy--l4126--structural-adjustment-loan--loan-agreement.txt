          provisions of the Loan Agreement and of these General
          Conditions."

     (b) "Section 6.03.  Cancellation by the Bank.  If (a) the right
of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account shall have
been suspended with respect to any amount of the Loan for a continuous
period of thirty days, or (b) at any time, the Bank determines, after
consultation with the Borrower, that an amount of the Loan will not be
required to finance the Project’s costs to be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan, or (c) at any time, the Bank determines, with
respect to any contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan,
that corrupt or fraudulent practices were engaged in by representatives
of the Borrower or of a beneficiary of the Loan during the procurement
or the execution of such contract, without the Borrower having taken
timely and appropriate action satisfactory to the Bank to remedy the
situation, and establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of
such contract which would otherwise have been eligible for financing
out of the proceeds of the Loan, or (d) at any time, the Bank deter-
mines that the procurement of any contract to be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or
referred to in the Loan Agreement and establishes the amount of
expenditures in respect of such contract which would otherwise have
been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan, or (e)
after the Closing Date, an amount of the Loan shall remain unwith-
drawn from the Loan Account, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower,
terminate the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals with respect
to such amount. Upon the giving of such notice, such amount of the

shall have given notice to the Borrower that the progress achieved and
actions taken are not satisfactory and, within 90 days after such

progress achieved in carrying out the Program, in such detail as
the Bank shall reasonably request.

     (c)  Without limitation upon the provisions of paragraph (a) of

2.   (a)  From the date of withdrawal of each amount of each Disbursed
Amount withdrawn and outstanding, to but not including the Rate Fixing

         (ii)  LIBOR Total Spread.

3.   For purposes of paragraph 2 of this Part B, the following terms

     (a)  "LIBOR Base Rate" means, for the Interest Period in which a

six-month deposits in Deutsche Mark for value the first day of such
Interest Period (or, in the case of the initial Interest Period, for
value the day occurring on the Interest Payment Date preceding the
first day of such Interest Period), as reasonably determined by the
Bank and expressed as a percentage per annum.

     (b)  "LIBOR Total Spread" means, for the Interest Period in which
each Disbursed Amount is withdrawn:

          (i)  one half of one percent (1/2 of 1%);

               Interest Period, below (or above) the London interbank
               offered rates, or other reference rates, for six-month
               deposits, in respect of the Bank’s outstanding
               borrowings or portions thereof allocated by the Bank
               to fund single currency loans or portions thereof made
               by it that include such Disbursed Amount for such
               Interest Period;

as reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage per
annum.

equivalent of the London interbank offered rate for six-month deposits
in Deutsche Mark for value on the Rate Fixing Date for such Disbursed
Amount, expressed as a single fixed interest rate based on the fixed
interest rates corresponding to the repayment installments of such
Disbursed Amount, as reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed
as a percentage per annum.

     (d)  "Fixed Total Spread" means, for each Disbursed Amount:

          (i)  one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%);

         (ii)  minus (or plus) the cost margin, applicable on the Rate
               Fixing Date for such Disbursed Amount, below (or above)
               the London interbank offered rates, or other reference
               rates, for six-month deposits, in respect of the Bank’s
               outstanding borrowings or portions thereof allocated to
               fund single currency loans or portions thereof made by
               it that include such Disbursed Amount; plus

        (iii)  the Bank’s risk spread applicable on the Rate Fixing
               Date for such Disbursed Amount;

as reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage per
annum.

4.   The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate, LIBOR Total
Spread, Fixed Base Rate and Fixed Total Spread applicable to each
Disbursed Amount, promptly upon the determination thereof.

5.   Whenever, in light of changes in market practice affecting the
determination of the interest rates referred to in this Schedule, the
Bank determines that it is in the interest of its borrowers as a
whole and of the Bank to apply a basis for determining the interest
rates applicable to the Loan other than as provided in this Schedule,
the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest rates
applicable to amounts of the Loan not yet withdrawn upon not less
than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower of the new basis. The new
basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice period
unless the Borrower notifies the Bank during said period of its
objection thereto, in which case said modification shall not apply

to the Loan.

C.   Repayment

Borrower shall repay each Disbursed Amount of the Loan in semiannual
installments payable on each April 15 and October 15, the first such
installment to be payable on the seventh (7th) Interest Payment Date
following the Rate Fixing Date for such Disbursed Amount and the
last such installment to be payable on the twenty-fourth (24th)
Interest Payment Date following the Rate Fixing Date for such
Disbursed Amount. Each installment shall be one-eighteenth (1/18) of
such Disbursed Amount.

2.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Part C, if
any installment of principal of each Disbursed Amount would, pursuant
to the provisions of said paragraph 1, be payable after April, 15,
2012, the Borrower shall also pay on said date the aggregate amount
of all such installments.

3.   After each Disbursed Amount shall have been withdrawn, the Bank
shall promptly notify the Borrower of the amortization schedule for
such Disbursed Amount.
