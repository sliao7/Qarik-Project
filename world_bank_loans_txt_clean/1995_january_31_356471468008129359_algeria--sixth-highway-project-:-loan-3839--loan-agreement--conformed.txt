furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be 

furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished 

pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.

Section II. Employment of Consultants 

1. In order to assist the Borrower in carrying out the Project, 

the Borrower shall employ consultants whose qualifications, 

experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be 

satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in 

accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank 

on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World 

Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published 

by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines). For complex, 

time-based assignments, the Borrower shall employ such consultants 

under contracts using the standard form of contract for consultants’ 

services issued by the Bank, with such modifications as shall have 

been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract 

documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use other 

standard forms agreed with the Bank. 

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, 

the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, 

letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts, 

shall not apply to (a) contracts for the employment of consulting 

firms estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each or (b) 

contracts for the employment of individuals estimated to cost less 

than $50,000 equivalent each. However, said exceptions to prior Bank 

review shall not apply to (a) the terms of reference for such 

contracts, (b) single-source selection of consulting firms, (c) 

assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined by the 

Borrower and the Bank, (d) amendments to contracts for the 

employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to 

$120,000 equivalent or above, or (e) amendments to contracts for the 

employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to 

$60,000 equivalent or above. 

SCHEDULE 5 

Special Account 

1. For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1), (2) 

and (3) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this 

Agreement ; 

(b). the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in 

respect of the reasonable cost of goods, works and services required 

for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan 

allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance 

with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount 

equivalent to $7,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and 

deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of 

this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall 

otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 

amount equivalent to $3,000,000 until the aggregate amount of 

withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all 

outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to 

Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed 

the equivalent of $10,000,000. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively 

for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this 

Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that 

the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the 

Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 

Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a 

deposit into the Special Account of an amount or amounts determined 

by the Bank to be required to pay for eligible expenditures during 

the four months following the date of each such request, which 

amount shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized 

Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank 

shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and
deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts as the Bank 

shall have determined to be so required. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 

deposits into the Special Account at such 

intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents 

and other evidence required pursuant to para- 

graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 

payments in respect of which replenishment is 

requested. On the basis of each such request, the 

Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 

from the Loan Account and deposit into the 

Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 

have requested and as shall have been shown by 

said documents and other evidence to have been 

paid out of the Special Account for eligible 

expenditures. All such deposits shall be 

withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under 

the respective eligible Categories, and in the 

respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been 

justified by said documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special 

Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall 

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 

evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 

expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 

Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 

into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all 

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 

Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the 

General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 

Agreement ; 

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the 

Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) 

of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished
to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the 

records and accounts for the Special Account; 

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the 

Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right 

of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant 

to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated 

to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding 

special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 

of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal 

the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories 

shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 

the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 

to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such 

amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date 

of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 

expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure 

or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 

Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 

provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 

deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 

refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 

the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 

shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 

Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 

evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 

cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 

shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 

outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 

Account.
(a) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 

(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account 

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General 

Conditions.
