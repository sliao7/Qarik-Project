                                SCHEDULE 2

                        Description of the Project

    The objectives of the Project are to stabilize the oil spill
area along the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline prior to the 1995
spring thaw to minimize the amount of oil released during
runoff and prevent ecological damage in the Pechora river
basin, continue the clean up in an environmentally appropriate
way and minimize, to the extent possible, damage to the
impacted areas, support safe pipeline operations in the near
term and evaluate the need for a replacement pipeline
investment project for the longer term, and identify and
implement other measures to mitigate against future oil spills.

    The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree
upon from time to time to achieve such objectives:

Part A:   Spill Containment and Clean-up

1.  Oil containment works, including site assessment,
construction of access roads, reinforcement of existing dikes
and construction of new dikes and other structures for oil
containment, recovery and processing of oil where possible and
pre-staging of equipment for recovery of oil that will be
released during spring flooding and implementation of social
assistance sub-projects (Social Assistance Sub-projects),
selected in accordance with criteria approved by the Bank, to
carry out emergency mitigation measures necessitated by the oil
spills in affected communities, as identified with state farms
and communities in the area, including emergency interventions
for public health, water supply interventions and provision of
forage for livestock.
