Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date

following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, 
if

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices

are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions

of such

adoption of such billing system.

upon a

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency 
that is

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,

shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency 
of

denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange 
rate

that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable 
by the

Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or 
(ii) if

the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines,

exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one 
Loan Currency,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for 
each

such amount.
