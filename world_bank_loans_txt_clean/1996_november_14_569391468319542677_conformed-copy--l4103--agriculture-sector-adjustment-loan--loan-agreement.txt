to the Borrower that the progress achieved and actions taken are not
satisfactory and, within ninety (90) days after such notice, the Borrower
shall not have achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the
Bank, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the unwith-
drawn amount of the Loan or any part thereof.

     Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be December 31, 1997, or such
later date as the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify

               the next following Interest Payment Date.

         (ii)  "Interest Payment Date" means any date specified in

               Dollars for value the first day of such Interest Period
               (or, in the case of the initial Interest Period, for
               value the Interest Payment Date occurring on or next
               preceding the first day of such Interest Period), as
               reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a
               percentage per annum.

the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower of

         Actions Referred to in Section 2.02 (d) of this Agreement

1.   Continued maintenance of a macroeconomic framework consistent with
the objectives of the Program as determined on the basis of performance
criteria acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank.

agricultural exports, with the exception of those covered by voluntary
export restraints, anti-dumping investigations, and those permitted
under the World Trade Organization Agreement.

3.   Enactment of amendments to the Land Code that would: (i) abolish
the existing 6-year moratorium on sale of land; and (ii) limit to
three (3) months the time within which co-owners can exercise their
preferential right to buy the share of land being sold by a co-owner.

4.   Enactment of legislation or other normative acts that would: (a)
give a right to 2 or more members of a collective agricultural enter-
prise, joint stock agricultural company or agricultural cooperative
(together, collective agricultural enterprises or CAEs) to withdraw
adjacent land plots from the said enterprise; (b) limit to three (3)
months the time period within which farm members’ council of a CAE
(or its authorized representatives) has to give its consent to the
plots of land requested by one or more members who filed an application
for withdrawal of the said plot(s) of land; and (c) give withdrawing
members of a CAE the right to: (i) appeal to designated authority in
the event the farm members’ council of the CAE fails to give its
consent within the three (3) months specified in sub-paragraph (b),
above, and (ii) receive ownership of his/her plot of land within 12

(ii) the procedures for exercising the said rights.

6.   Enactment of legislation establishing a national unified registry
for all immovable property, including rural and urban land and other
real estate, including buildings.

75% of entitled beneficiaries in such CAEs; and (ii) completed the
process of exchanging land share certificates for physically identified
land plots of at least 75 CAEs.

8.   Submission of evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that demonstrates
that starting in November 1996, all state agricultural procurement by
state agencies has been carried out on a competitive basis through open
tenders and/or agricultural commodity exchanges in a manner facilitating
private sector participation.

9.   The Borrower has implemented a methodology for privatization of
agro-industrial enterprises, which: (i) has shortened the periods for
the corporatization and share subscription processes to a period
approximating the corresponding periods achieved for analogous enter-
prises in other sectors, and (ii) ensures that shares in these agro-
industrial enterprises that are subject to transfer on preferential
terms to primary producers of agricultural raw materials, shall be
transferred to physical persons and not to any collective structures.

10.  Submission of evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, showing that as
part of the 1994 State Privatization Program, the Borrower has offered
for privatization, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the
Bank, at least seventy percent (70%) of the equity in at least 1,000
medium and large-scale agro-industrial enterprises (defined as enter-
prise groups B, C and D in the 1994 State Privatization Program), not

enterprises or enterprise associations, including at least five (5)
state-owned national monopoly enterprises or enterprise associations
engaged in the processing of agricultural products and in material
technical input supply.  For the purposes of this paragraph, regional

or national monopoly enterprise or enterprise association is defined
as an enterprise or enterprise association that controls at least 30%
of the relevant market.
