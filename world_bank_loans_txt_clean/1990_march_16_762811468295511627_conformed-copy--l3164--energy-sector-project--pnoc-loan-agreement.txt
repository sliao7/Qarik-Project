SCHEDULE 4

Special Account

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a) the term "eligible Categories" means Categories
set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement;

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means
expenditures in respect of the reasonable cost of goods
and services required for Part (A) of the Project and to
be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated
from time to time to the eligible Categories in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this
Agreement; and

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an
amount equivalent to $10,000,000 to be withdrawn from the
Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
 
2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with
the provisions of this Schedule.
 
3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to
it that the Special Account has been duly opened,
withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be
made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or
requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.

(b)  (i) For replenishment of the Special Account,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank
requests for deposits into the Special
Account at such intervals as the Bank
shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such

request, the Borrower shall furnish to
the Bank the documents and other evidence
required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this
Schedule for the payment or payments in

respect of which replenishment is
requested. On the basis of each such
request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit into the Special Account such
amount as the Borrower shall have
requested and as shall have been shown by
said documents and other evidence to have
been paid out of the Special Account for
eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories,
and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have
been justified by said documents and other evidence.
 
4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the
Special Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the
Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such
documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
 
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make
further deposits into the Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the
Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the General
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories for Part A of the
Project, less the amount of any outstanding special
commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to Part A of
the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the
amount of the Authorized Allocation.
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories for Part A of the Project shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by
notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be
made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on
deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such
notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

6.   (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made
for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide
such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall
so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in the Special Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to
the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
