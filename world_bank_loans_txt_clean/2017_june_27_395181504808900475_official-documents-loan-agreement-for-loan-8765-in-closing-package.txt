Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
