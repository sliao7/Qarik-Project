SCHEDULE 1

Program Actions; Availability of Loan Proceeds

Section I. Actions under the Program

The actions taken by the Borrower under the Program include the following:

Pillar A: Improving Quality of Spending

1. The Borrower has increased the share of the central government budget allocated to
infrastructure, social assistance and health sectors, compared to pre-fuel subsidy reform years
(2012-2014), as evidenced through the 2016 Budget Law, Financial Note for 2016 State
Budget and the Presidential Regulation 137/2015.

2. The DG Treasury has completed the roll-out of the financial management information system
(SPAN) to all regional treasury offices, as evidenced through the issuance of the Certificate
of Operational Acceptance to the service provider.

3. The Borrower has enabled its ministries and agencies to engage in Availability Payment
Contracts for infrastructure projects with the private sector, as evidenced through the
Presidential Regulation 38/2015, Minister of Finance Regulation 190/2015, Head of
Bappenas Regulation 4/2015 and Head of LKPP Regulation 19/2015.

4. The Minister of Finance has reduced major barriers for ministries and agencies to issue multi-
year contracts for government procurement by: (a) not requiring the land acquisition process,
which remains necessary, to be completed prior to submission of multi-year contracts to the
Minister of Finance; (b) eliminating the requirement for an external audit for no-cost contract
extensions; and (c) increasing the flexibility of annual budget reallocation for multi-year
contracts, as evidenced through the Minister of Finance Regulation 238/2015.

5. The Borrower has enabled the increased usage of early procurement for capital projects listed
in the 2016 State Budget, as evidenced through the Presidential Instruction 1/2015, Minister
of Public Works and Housing Instruction 3/2015 and Minister of Finance Circular Letter S-
577/2015.

Pillar B: Strengthening Revenue Administration

6. The DG Taxes has launched in July 1, 2015 an electronic VAT invoice online application
that ensures systematic submission of detailed information on taxable goods and services by
taxpayers, as evidenced through the DG Taxes Decree 136/2014.

7. The DG Taxes has reduced the burden of the Validation Process for individual e-filing by
allowing tax officers to validate on the premises of employers with twenty or more
employees, as evidenced through the DG Taxes Regulation 41/2015.

7 of 16 LN 8618-ID

8. The DG Taxes has abolished the statement of regional information in the taxpayer
identification number so that taxpayers will not receive new tax IDs when they move to a
different region as a major step in establishing a unique and permanent taxpayer
identification system, as evidenced through the DG Taxes Circular Letter SE 44/2015.

9. The DG Taxes and BPN have implemented an electronic data exchange to enable DG Taxes
to access taxpayers' land asset data held by BPN for compliance purposes in a systematic
manner.

Pillar C: Enhancing Tax Policy

10. The Minister of Finance has submitted to the Minister of Law and Human Rights the white
paper (naskah akademik) for the revision of the VAT and LGST Law No. 42 of 2009 that
recommends: (a) broadening the VAT base by rationalizing exemptions and limiting the
Ministry of Finance's discretion in granting exemptions; (b) replacing vehicle LGST with a
vehicle excise tax; and (c) incorporating remaining LGST goods into the VAT regime.

11. The Minister of Finance has established a maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 4:1 for
calculating the allowable deduction from interest paid on debt to address thin capitalization,
as evidenced through the Minister of Finance Regulation 169/2015.

Section II. Availability of Loan Proceeds

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment
Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment
Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as of
such date in accordance with paragraph I of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on each
Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the
table in paragraph I of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original
Installment Share") and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date,
such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred
to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on
the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be
repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal
Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any time
the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after
the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no
longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the
Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to
the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
