about 255 km of high priority surface 
facilities, particularly, oil gathering lines, 
pipelines and water conduits, in the above 
mentioned fields. 

(iii) In-fi11 Drilling: In-fill and step-out drilling 
of about 76 wells in the Megion and Pokamovskoye

Oil Field Modernization: Workover and 
modernization of about 525 wells including 
provision of measuring facilities, in the 
Sovietskoye, Vahk and Vasugan fields, in wells 

judged to provide adequate economic returns and 
which do not interfere with wells currently 
under or previously committed to contract to 
other parties. 

Surface Facility Replacement: Reconstruction of 
about 576 km of high priority surface 
facilities, particularly, oil gathering lines, 
pipelines and water conduits, in the above 
mentioned fields. 

In-fill Drilling: In-fill and step-out drilling 
of about 11 wells in the above mentioned fields. 

Environmental Protection: Enhancement of the 
Association’s emergency response, environmental 

monitoring and management capabilities 
(including relations with indigenous peoples) 
through provision of training, manuals and 
equipment and initiation of trial clean-up 
programs, such as bioremediation, for previous 
spills and damage. 

Field Optimization Study: Carry out a 
comprehensive field optimization study in one of
the fields currently under production aimed at 
identifying and evaluating optimal plans for 
future operation of the field including both 
subsurface and surface facility considerations. 
The program would include provision of computer 
equipment and services, plus training to 

undertake reservoir analysis and simulations.

Oil Field Modernization: Workover and 
modernization of about 576 wells including 
provision of measuring facilities, in the 
Mamantova and Srednye Asomkinskoye fields, in 
wells judged to provide adequate economic 
returns and which do not interfere with wells 
currently under or previously committed to 
contract to other parties. 

In-fill Drilling: In-fill and step-out drilling 
of about 40 wells in the Mamantova and 
Prirazlomnoye fields, including the drilling of 
horizontal wells from existing wellpads to avoid 
drilling in environmentally sensitive regions of 
the field and including associated surface 
facilities. 

Environmental Protection: Enhancement of the 
Association’s emergency response, environmental 

monitoring and management capabilities 
(including relations with indigenous peoples) 
through provision of training, manuals and
