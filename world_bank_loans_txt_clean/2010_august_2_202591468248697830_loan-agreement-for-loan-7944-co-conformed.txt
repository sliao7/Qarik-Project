(a) Before issuing any invitation to bid, the Borrower shall use, or cause to

bidding under the Project and incorporated in the Project Operational 
Manual (the “Standard Bidding Documents”). Any change or departure 
from the Standard Bidding Document approved by the Bank shall require 
its prior approval. 

(b) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or citizens of the

preference will be granted to any bidder or group of bidders for bid 
evaluation purposes. Bidders shall be allowed to submit their bids by 
hand or through the post office or private mailing services. There shall 
not be any requirement for any bidder to show evidence of the bidder's 
registration in any public registry, chamber of commerce or similar 
entity, whether in the Borrower’s territory or elsewhere, or to appoint a 
representative domiciled in Borrower’s territory, unless and until such 
bidder is awarded the corresponding contract.

representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and

lowest evaluated bid. Such determination shall be made exclusively on 
the basis of the specifications, conditions and evaluation criteria 

stipulated in the bidding documents. If any factor additional to the 
amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid evaluation, such 
factor or factors and the quantified manner on which they will be applied 
for purposes of determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely 
stipulated in the bidding documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and

including correction of arithmetic errors.

more specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the 
persons officially charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating 
the bids while they are performing their official duties, without the

be required to provide such authorization as a condition to be entitled to 
bid. This confidentiality requirement shall apply until the award of 
contract is notified to the successful bidder. Thereafter, confidentiality of
