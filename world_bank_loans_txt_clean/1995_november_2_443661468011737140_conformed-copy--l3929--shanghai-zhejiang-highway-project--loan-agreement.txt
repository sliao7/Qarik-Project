SCHEDULE 4

Special Accounts

1. For the purposes of this Schedule:

(a) the term "eligible Categories" means for the Zhejiang Special Account, 
Categories 1, 2, 3, and 4,  (collectively the Zhejiang Categories) and for the 
Shanghai Special Account, Categories 6, 7, 8 and 9, (collectively the Shanghai 
Categories), all as set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement;

(b) the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to:

(i) $12,500,000, for the Zhejiang Special Account; and

(ii) $4,000,000, for the Shanghai Special Account;
 
to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into such Special Account pursuant 
to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank shall 
otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to 
$7,000,000 for the Zhejiang Special Account and $2,000,000 for the Shanghai Special 
Account until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total 
amount of all outstanding special commitments
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be 
equal to or exceed the equivalent of $75,000,000 and $20,000,000 for the Zhejiang 
Categories and the Shanghai Categories respectively.

2. Payments out of a Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that a Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the said Special Account shall be made as follows:

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into said Special Account of an amount 
or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On 
the basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into said Special Account such amount or 
amounts as the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of said Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into said Special Account 
at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 

of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into said Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall 
have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the said Special Account for 
eligible expenditures.

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the 
respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said documents and other evidence.

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of a Special Account, the Borrower 
shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into a Special Account:

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the 
period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit 
reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for said Special Account; 

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals 
from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 
by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to said 
Categories, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized 
Allocation.

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the said Special Account as of the date of such notice will be 
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of a 
Special Account:

(i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or

(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:

(A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or

(B) deposit into said Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so 
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of 
such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified.

Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into said 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made 
such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in said Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in said Special Account.

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
