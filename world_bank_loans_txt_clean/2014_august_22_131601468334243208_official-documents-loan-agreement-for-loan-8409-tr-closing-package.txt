Amortization Schedule 

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 

withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the 
Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 

first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage)

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 

each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the 

Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph | 

of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such 

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the 
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this 

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original 

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 

Conversion applies.
(a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 

principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 

withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 

Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 

invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated 
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for 

each such amount.
