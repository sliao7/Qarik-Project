efficiency in public buildings and ESCOs, including budgeting 
rules to allow for budget savings retention, financing of public 
building renovations, public procurement rules to support ESCOs

(v)

respect to a building for which a Subproject is being proposed: 

(i) the building must be owned by, or has been legally assigned to, 
the central government (excluding publicly-owned enterprises, 
and private buildings with public agency tenants); 

(ii) (A) the construction permit for the building was issued in or after 
January 2000, and (B) for buildings whose construction permit 
was issued before January 2000, the building is officially assessed 
by a civil engineer (registered with the Turkish Chamber of Civil 
Engineers) as structurally and seismically safe, and such 

(a) 

(b) 

(a) 

(b) 

assessment has been accepted by MoEU (recognizing that should 

a building be assessed as not structurally and seismically sound, 
the related structural works to address such deficiencies may be 
added to a Subproject only if the total cost of the renovations 
(i.e., energy efficiency and structural works) have a payback 
period of under twelve (12) years)); 

(iii) | the building must be in operation for at least five years, and has 
not had a comprehensive energy efficiency renovation completed 
in the ten (10) years prior to date of the Subproject proposal; 

(iv) on the basis of the building administrator’s confirmation, the 
building is not planned for relocation, closure, demolition or 

privatization; 

(v) the building is not used for, nor is it intended to be used for, law 
enforcement, security or defense purposes (e.g., police, prisons, 

military); and 

(vi) the Subproject investments shall not involve any Excluded 

Activities. 

Annual Subproject investments shall be within the thresholds established 

pursuant to Section I.D of this Schedule. 

In the event that Subproject applications exceed annual investment 
thresholds for Subprojects, the Borrower, through MoEU, shall rank 
qualifying Subprojects based on whether the buildings have Energy 
Audits, energy performance certificates or registration with MoENR for 

monitoring energy consumption, higher annual energy consumption, 
larger number of beneficiaries, and broad geographical coverage. 

To qualify for financing under Part 1 of the Project, prior to the start of 
each Subproject, the Borrower, through MoEU, shall issue to each 

Subproject beneficiary (e.g., hospital) a project initiation letter, and obtain 
the signature of the authorized representative of the respective Subproject 

beneficiary (e.g., building administrator) to the project initiation letter. 

As further detailed in the POM, each project initiation letter shall outline 
the building renovation processes and procedures, and the respective 
parties’ roles, responsibilities and obligations in connection with the 

renovations, including specifically recognizing that (i) each Subproject is 
to be carried out in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the 
POM, and (ii) the Subproject beneficiary shall enable the MoEU and the 
World Bank to inspect the Subproject and any relevant records and 

(c) 

documents, and to prepare and furnish to the MoEU and the World Bank 
all such information as the MoEU or the World Bank shall reasonably 

request relating to the foregoing. 

The Borrower, through MoEU, shall exercise its rights under each project 
initiation letter in such manner as to protect the interests of the Borrower 
and the Bank and to accomplish the purposes of the Loan and IBRD Loan. 
Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not assign, 
amend, abrogate or waive any project initiation letter or any of its 

provisions.

of financing; and (iii) any training activities that may be required under 
the Project including (A) the type of training, (B) the purpose of the 
training, and (C) the cost of the training; 

afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange views with MoEU 
and MoENR on each such proposed Annual Work Plan and Budget, and 
shall thereafter ensure that the Project is implemented with due diligence 
during said following year, in accordance with such Annual Work Plan 

and Budget as shall have been approved by the Bank; and 

not make or allow to be made any change to the approved Annual Work 
Plan and Budget without the Bank’s prior written approval. 

Without prejudice to Section 1.D.1 above, and for the purposes of Part 1 (a) (i) and 

Part 1 (a) (ii) of the Project:
