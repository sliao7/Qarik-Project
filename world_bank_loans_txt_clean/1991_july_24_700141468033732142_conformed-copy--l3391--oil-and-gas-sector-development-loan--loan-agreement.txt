                            Procurement

1.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to
cost the equivalent of $5,000,000 or more each shall be
awarded through international competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures consistent with those set
forth in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published
by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines), subject to the
following modifications:

      (a)   Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and
the following is substituted therefor:

      "2.8  Notification and Advertising

            The international community should be notified
      in a timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This
      will be done by advertising invitations to apply
      for inclusion in a bidder’s invitation list, to
      apply for prequalification, or to bid; such adver-
      tisements should be placed in at least one newspa-
      per of general circulation in the Borrower’s coun-
      try and, in addition, in at least one of the fol-
      lowing forms:

      (i)   a notice in the United Nations publication,
            Development Forum, Business Edition; or

     (ii)   an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or
            technical journal of wide international circu-
            lation; or

    (iii)   a notice to local representatives of countries
            and territories referred to in the Guidelines,
            that are potential suppliers of the goods
            required."

      (b)   The following is added at the end of paragraph
2.21 of the Guidelines:

            "As a further alternative, bidding documents
      may require the bidder to state the bid price in a
      single currency widely used in international trade
      and specified in the bidding documents."

      (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56  of the Guidelines are
deleted.

2.    Contracts for commonly traded commodities may be

awarded on the basis of prices available from organized
international commodity markets in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Bank.

3.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to
cost the equivalent of less than $5,000,000 shall be
awarded:

      (a)   by purchasers required to follow the Borrower’s
public procurement procedures for the importation of
goods, on the basis of such procedures, provided that
such procedures shall have been found acceptable by the
Bank;

      (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with
established commercial practice, provided that such
contracts shall be awarded on the basis of evaluation
comparison of quotations obtained from suppliers from at
least two countries, except that direct contracting
procedures acceptable to the Bank may be used where
considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the
Guidelines; and

      (c)   by any purchasers, for the supply of commodi-
ties, on the basis of evaluation and comparison of
quotations obtained from more than one supplier.

4.  With respect to each contract referred to in para-
graph 1 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to
the Bank, prior to the submission to the Bank of the
first application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan
Account in respect of such contract, two conformed copies
of such contract, together with the analysis of the
respective bids and recommendations for award, a descrip-
tion of the advertising and tendering procedures followed
and such other information as the Bank shall reasonably
request.

5.    With respect to each contract referred to in
paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish
to the Bank, prior to the submission to the Bank of the
first application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan
Account in respect thereof, such documentation and
information as the Bank may reasonably request to support
withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.

6.    The provisions of the preceding paragraph 5 of this
Schedule shall not apply to contracts on account of which
the Bank has authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account
on the basis of statements of expenditure.
