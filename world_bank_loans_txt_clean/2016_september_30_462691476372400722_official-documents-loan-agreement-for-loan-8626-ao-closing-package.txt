during the public bid opening session, except for late bids. Bidders shall
not be allowed to complete their bids after the deadline for submission of

(n) Bid Validity. No automatic extension of the bid validity shall apply. If
justified by exceptional circumstances, an extension of the bid validity
may be requested in writing from all bidders before the original bid
validity expiration date and it shall cover only the minimum period
required to complete the evaluation and award of the contract. The
extension of the bid validity requires the Bank's no objection for those
contracts subject to prior review.

(o) Bid Evaluation
(i) Evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the
evaluation criteria declared in the bidding documents. Evaluation
criteria other than price shall be quantified in monetary terms and

given at least fifteen (15) days from the receipt of notification of contract

award to submit a performance security. No advance payment shall be

made without a suitable advance payment security.

(r) Publication of Contract Award. Information on contract award shall be

published at least in a national newspaper of wide circulation within two

(2) weeks of receiving the Bank's no objection to the award
recommendation for contracts subject to prior review, and within two (2)

weeks from the award decision for contracts subject to post review.

Publication shall include the following information: (i) the name of each

bidder which submitted a bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening;

(t) Contract and Contract Modifications. Contracts shall be in writing and
the bid of the successful bidder shall become part of the Contract
documents without any modification introduced by the contracting
authority. In the case of contracts subject to prior review, the Bank's no
objection shall be obtained before agreeing to: (i) a material extension of
the stipulated time for performance of a contract; (ii) any substantial
modification of the scope of services or other significant changes to the
terms and conditions of the contract; (iii) any variation order or

or (iv) the proposed termination of the contract. A copy of all contract
amendments shall be furnished to the Bank for its record;

(u) Right to Inspect/Audit. In accordance with the Procurement Guidelines,
each bidding document and contract financed from the proceeds of the
Loan shall provide that bidders, suppliers, and contractors, and their sub-
contractors, agents, personnel, consultants, service providers or suppliers,
shall permit the Bank, at its request, to inspect their accounts, records and

other documents relating to the submission of bids and contract
performance, and to have them audited by auditors appointed by the Bank.
Acts intended to materially impede the exercise of the Bank's inspection
and audit rights constitute an obstructive practice as defined in the

Procurement Guidelines.

(v) Fraud and Corruption. In accordance with the Procurement Guidelines,
each bidding document and contract financed from the proceeds of the
Loan shall include provisions on matters pertaining to fraud and
corruption. The Bank will sanction a firm or individual, at any time, in
accordance with prevailing Bank sanctions procedures, including by
publicly declaring such firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or
for a stated period of time: (i) to be awarded a Bank-financed contract; and

provider of an otherwise eligible firm being awarded a Bank-financed
contract;

afforded due process and the debarment decision is final.

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal
Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such
repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

Principal Payment Date Installment Share
(Expressed as a Percentage)

On each April land October 1
Beginning October 1, 2021

Through October 1, 2034 3.57%

On April 1, 2035 3.61%

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) to the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn
Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this
Schedule; and

(b) any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.
3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal
Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,

shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the

exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each

such amount.
