Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 

of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 

Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 

multiplying: (i) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 

the first Principal Payment Date; by (ii) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 

Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 

referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Installment Share 

 Payment Date (Expressed as a %) 

On each April 15 and October 15

of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 

outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 

amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 

a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 

table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original 

Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining 

Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, 

such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 

in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.
3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal 

Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 

on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 

the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 

if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 

issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-

paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 

billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 

to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 

be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 

shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 

denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 

reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 

the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so 

determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 

of the Screen Rate. 

5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 

shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 

shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 

produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the  Special Account 

has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 

withdrawals to replenish the  Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 

to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 

amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the 

basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 

from the Loan Account and deposit into the  Special Account such amount or amounts as 

the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 

furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special Account 

at such intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 

furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required 

pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 

payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the
basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the 

Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the 

Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall have 

requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 

other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for 

eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by 

the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible 

Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 

have been justified by said documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the 

Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank 

such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 

eligible expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 

not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 

withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 

accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) 

of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; 

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period 

of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports 

required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the 

records and accounts for the Special Account; 

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention 

to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the 

Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 

Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into 

by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the 

equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 

the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 

shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only 

after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 

remaining on deposit in the  Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized 

in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the   

Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 

paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 

additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the  Special Account (or, 

if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such 

payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall 

otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made 

until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the 

case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount 

outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 

eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 

the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or 

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 

this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 

cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the 

General Conditions.
