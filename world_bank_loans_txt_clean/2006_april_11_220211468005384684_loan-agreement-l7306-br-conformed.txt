SCHEDULE 2 

First Phase of the Program 

1. A national housing policy (Política Nacional de Habitação) was issued by MOC 
and approved by the Borrower’s Council of Cities (Conselho das Cidades) in November 
2004, defining principles, guidelines and general objectives for the housing sector, and 
presenting proposals for the formulation of a national housing plan, to be discussed 
within the Borrower’s government, which includes goals, investment plans and 
performance indicators for the housing sector.  

2. The Borrower's Ministers of Finance and of Cities have agreed to create an inter-
ministerial working group to monitor the impact of Resolution 3259 and other housing 
market-based instruments, and to elaborate proposals to rationalize the Borrower's 
housing subsidy programs. 

3. Bill of Law PLC No. 36/2004, which provides for the creation of the national 
social interest housing fund (Fundo Nacional de Habitação de Interesse Social) to 
coordinate transfers, subsidies and funding structures for low income housing 
beneficiaries, was approved by the Borrower’s House of Representatives (Câmara dos 
Deputados) on June 3, 2004.  

4. The Borrower’s Law No. 10.931/2004 was enacted to strengthen the Borrower’s 
housing credit regulatory framework by: (a) regulating real estate credit instruments; (b) 
establishing that the land and the structures or improvements thereon under any real 
estate development are assets separate from those of the real estate developer (patrimônio 
de afetação), introducing more efficient means of inspection of the real estate 
development, and making feasible the continuity of construction works in case of 
bankruptcy of the developer; (c) simplifying the tax regime of the assets referred to in (b) 
above; and (d) establishing a more efficient procedure for judicial resolution of disputes 
between real estate developers and purchasers of real estate units. 

5. Resolution 3259 revised prior regulations dealing with the mandatory use of 
savings account funds for housing financing to bring them in line with the capacity of the 
institutions in the housing and finance sectors, and created incentives for housing 
financing for the low income population.   

6. Resolution No. 460, of FGTS Conselho Curador (Managing Council), dated 
December 14, 2004, was approved to improve the targeting and transparency of the 
FGTS interest rate subsidy program by: (a) including the creation of an explicit upfront 
subsidy differentiated by income group; (b) establishing that, by 2008, all FGTS 
resources will benefit households with a monthly income equivalent to less than 10 

minimum wages; and (c) increasing the amount of credit available for households with a 
monthly income equivalent to less than six minimum wages in 2005. 

7. The Borrower’s Law No. 10998, of December 15, 2004, revised the Programa de 
Subsídio à Habitação Social, a transparent upfront housing subsidy program financed 
from the Borrower’s budget, which now may be implemented through schemes that may 
or may not include additional credit lines. 

8. A framework was established by MOC for the monitoring and evaluation system 
of the Borrower’s housing program, with particular attention to the subsidies component.  

9. The Borrower issued, in 2003, a national policy for sustainable urban land tenure 
regularization (política nacional de regularização fundiária sustentável -  Programa 
Papel Passado) to secure land titles to the poor, and has been implementing such policy 
in a satisfactory manner.  

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share). If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying: (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 
the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 
Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Payment Date
Installment Share 

(Expressed as a %)

On each June 15 and December 15  
 
Beginning June 15, 2010  
 through June 15, 2021 4.17% 
 
On December 15, 2021 

4.09% 

2. If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original 
Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining 

Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 
if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (a) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (b) if the Bank so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate. 

5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
