Supplemental Loan and the percentage of the total principal amount of the 
Supplemental Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date (Installment Share).  
If the proceeds of the Supplemental Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as of

repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined 
by the Bank by multiplying:  (i) the total principal amount of the Supplemental 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (ii) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayment amount 
to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in sub-paragraph 
(d) of this paragraph, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Payment Date Installment Share 
(Expressed as a %)

On each January 15 and July 15 
Beginning on July 15, 2013 through July 15, 
2018 

8.33% 

On January 15, 2019 8.37% 

(b) If the proceeds of the Supplemental Loan shall not have been fully 
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the 
Supplemental Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date 
shall be determined as follows: 

(i) To the extent that any proceeds of the Supplemental 
Loan shall have been withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount 
withdrawn and outstanding as of such date in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this Schedule.
(ii) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment 
Date shall be repaid on each Principal Payment Date 
falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of 
each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of 
which shall be the original Installment Share specified in 
the table in paragraph (a) of this Schedule for said 
Principal Payment Date (the Original Installment Share) 
and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all 
remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal 
Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such 
repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to 
deduct any amounts referred to in sub-paragraph (d) of 
this paragraph, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

(c) (i) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to 
any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as 
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the 
date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of  
withdrawal. 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (i) of 
this paragraph (c), if at any time the Bank shall adopt a 
due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply 
to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this paragraph, upon a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the 
withdrawn principal amount of the Supplemental Loan to an Approved Currency, 
the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall be repayable on 
any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange 
rate that reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by 
the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or 
(ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the 
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
(e) If the principal amount of the Supplemental Loan withdrawn and 
outstanding from time to time shall be denominated in more than one Loan 
Currency, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply separately to the amount 
denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization 
schedule for each such amount.”

read “Procurement and Consultants’ Services under the Initial Loan”. 

Section 2.13. The subtitle of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement is amended to

from the Loan Account and deposit into the Supplemental Loan Special Account such 
amount or amounts as the Borrower, through PSI, shall have requested. 

(b)      (i) For replenishment of the Supplemental Loan Special Account, 
the Borrower, through PSI, shall furnish to the Bank requests for 
deposits into the Supplemental Loan Special Account at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify.
(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower, 
through PSI, shall furnish to the Bank the documents and other 
evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for 
the payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested.  On the basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on 
behalf of the Borrower, through PSI, withdraw from the Loan 
Account and deposit into the Supplemental Loan Special 
Account such amount as the Borrower, through PSI, shall have 
requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of the Supplemental Loan 
Special Account for eligible expenditures.  All such deposits 
shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under 
the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective 
equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower, through PSI, out of the Supplemental 
Loan Special Account, the Borrower, through PSI, shall, at such time as the Bank shall 
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that 
such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Supplemental Loan Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower, through PSI, directly from the 
Supplemental Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the Fixed-
Spread Loan General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.09 of this Agreement; 

(b) if the Borrower, through PSI, shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, 
within the period of time specified in Section 4.03 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the 
audit reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for the Supplemental Loan Special Account; 

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention 
to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the 
Supplemental Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General 
Conditions; or 

 (d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Supplemental Loan allocated 
to the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments 
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Fixed-Spread Loan General
Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Supplemental Loan 
Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Supplemental Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Supplemental Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall 
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further 
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Supplemental Loan Special 
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Supplemental Loan Special Account:  (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount 
not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the 
evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:  
(A) provide such Supplemental evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the 
Supplemental Loan Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) 
an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Supplemental Loan Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Supplemental Loan Special Account will not be required to cover 
further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice 
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or 
any portion of the funds on deposit in the Supplemental Loan Special Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) 
of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or 
for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, 
including the General Conditions.
