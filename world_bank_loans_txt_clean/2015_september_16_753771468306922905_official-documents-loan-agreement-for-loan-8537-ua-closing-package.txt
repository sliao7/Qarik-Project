repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount

of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the

original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after

the adoption of such billing system.

upon a

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period,

shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency 
of

denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange 
rate

that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the

Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; 
or (ii) if

the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines,

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than

denominated

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization 
schedule for each

such amount.
