SCHEDULE 1 

Program Description 

The objective of the Program is to increase the coverage of primary health care for 

underserved populations and improve the efficiency of health spending by addressing underlying 

institutional challenges. 

The Program consists of the following activities: 

Results area 1: Improving PHC coverage for underserved populations 

This results area aims to improve PHC coverage for underserved population by addressing 
the physical, financial, and social challenges they face. 

(a) To address physical challenges related to access to PHC, the Program will expand 

community health care and strengthen its collaboration with PHC. Community 

health nurses and Roma health mediators will be hired, trained and deployed to 
communities to provide community-based interventions. 

(b) To address social challenges faced by vulnerable groups, the Program will assist 

targeted communities (including marginalized communities) to receive health 

education and support to navigate the health care system, particularly PHC. 

(c) To address financial challenges to PHC, the Borrower aims to provide the basic 

package of PHC to the uninsured in Romania. 

Results area 2: Rebalancing the hospital-centric system toward effective PHC 

This results area aims to rebalance the hospital-centric system toward effective PHC by 

addressing the institutional challenges: underinvestment in PHC, misalignment of incentives that 

is embedded in NHIH’s provider payment mechanisms, and regulatory restrictions on the scope of 

PHC services. The Borrower plans a set of initiatives to make PHC comprehensive, widely 

accessible, and effective. 

(a) One initiative under the Program will be to revise the package of services in PHC 

to expand the number of services, including prescriptions for exams and 

medications to control the most prevalent noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and 

increase the supply of preventive services for adults and children, such as annual 

medical check-ups. 

(b) To increase the supply of PHC, the Program will revise the provider payment 

mechanisms and expand scope of services, incentivizing family physicians to 
improve the effectiveness of services. 

(c) Underinvestment in PHC will be addressed under the Program through: (i) increase
in the budgetary allocation to PHC; and (ii) establishment of a de minimis aid 

scheme to provide grants and loans to: (a) facilitate the establishment of family 

medicine practices in areas where no PHC is available; and (b) improve the quality 

of existing PHC. 

Results area 3: Improving health expenditure efficiency by addressing critical cost drivers 

This results area aims to increase the efficiency of health expenditure by addressing critical 
cost drivers, including high spending on pharmaceuticals, devices and supplies and by 

improving access to and use of information. 

(a) 

(b) 

The Program will support more effective implementation of centralized 

procurement and pharmaceutical policies to better control spending on medical 
products. 

The Program will support improvements in health information management to 

ensure standardization, and interoperability of the existing subsystems, to facilitate 
access to information and enable evidence-based decision-making.
