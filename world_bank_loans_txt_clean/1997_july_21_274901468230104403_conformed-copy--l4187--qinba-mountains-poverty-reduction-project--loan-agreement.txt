having taken timely and appropriate action satisfactory to the Bank to remedy the 

situation, and establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of such

otherwise have been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan, 
or (e) after the Closing Date, an amount of the Loan shall remain
