works estimated to cost less than US$2,000,000 equivalent each or goods 
contracts that are estimated to cost less than US$300,000 equivalent

declaration that, if the bidder withdraws its bid during the bid validity

two (2) years from being awarded any contract with the Borrower, Gansu

established by the Borrower.

responsive bidder, that is, the bidder who meets the appropriate standards 
of capability and resources and whose bid has been determined: (A) to be

and records relating to bid submission and contract performance and to 
have said accounts and records audited by auditors appointed by the

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”)

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
