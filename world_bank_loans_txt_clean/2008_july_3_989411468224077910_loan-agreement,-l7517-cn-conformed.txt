(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the

withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
