                              Special Account
1.  For the purposes of this Schedule:
    (a)   the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1) through (3)
set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
    (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of
the reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to
be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to
the eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement; and
    (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to
$5,500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into the
Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.  Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and
subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as
follows:
    (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
          (b)  (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower
                     shall furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into
                     the Special Account at such intervals as the Bank
                     shall specify.
              (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                     Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents and
                     other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of
                     this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect
                     of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of
                     each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                     Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit
                     into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                     shall have requested and as shall have been shown by
                     said documents and other evidence to have been paid
                     out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under
the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish
to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was
made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account:
    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further

withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account
in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and
paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
Page  10
    (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn
amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the
Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.
6.  (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out
of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may
request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so
request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment
or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account
shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
    (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
    (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all
or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
    (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c)
of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent
withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
                                                                  ANNEX 1

Page  12
del proyecto y aquellas recomendaciones que mejoren la eficiencia en la
operacion del proyecto, cuya incorporacion previamente sera acordada con el
Banco durante la revision anual que se llevara a cabo en octubre de 1996.
                                                                  ANNEX 3

                      Environmental Screening Process

The environmental screening process to be applied to all investment
projects to be financed under the Loan (subprojects) will be done in
accordance with the agreement between the National Water Commission and the
Guarantor's Secretariat for Social Development (SEDESOL).  This agreement
includes the following key points, which shall not be changed during the
course of Project implementation without the agreement of the Bank:
1.    Group 1: projects in biosphere reserves.  They are forbidden and FIRCO
excludes all such subprojects.
2.    Group 2: new subprojects and expansion of existing systems.  FIRCO
subprojects that require this type of screening are: (a) subprojects that
include the perforation of tubewells, and (ii) irrigation projects of more
than 100 hectares.  Some FIRCO subprojects fall in CNA's Group 2 and require
SEDESOL's explicit opinion.  Most subprojects in this group require more
detailed study, either an Environmental Protection Report or an
Environmental Impact Study, which is usually prepared by consultants and is
then forwarded to SEDESOL for its decision.
3.    Group 3: subprojects for which, according to Mexican law, no
environmental assessment is required because they are too small.
Subprojects in this group include: (a) dams with a holding capacity of less
than 500,000 cubic metres; (b) isolated water wells; (c) irrigation areas
of less than 100 hectares; (d) irrigation systems that draw less than 10 %
of the natural replenishment capacity of the natural water source on which
they depend; and (e) rehabilitated systems for use of groundwater.  For such
subprojects the producers prepare a 'diagnosis of environmental impact'
(diagnostico de impacto ambiental) and the relevant authority (CNA, SEDESOL
or SARH) gives its clearance.
4.    Virtually all subprojects are expected to fall under the Group 3
environmental selection criteria.  However, all subprojects that exploit
groundwater, whether in Group 2 or Group 3, require procedures to obtain the
authorization of CNA for extraction of the specified volume of water before
any agreement is made with FIRCO.  Subprojects for groundwater extraction
are forbidden in exclusion zones defined by CNA (zonas de veda).
5.    Group 4: subprojects for which construction of civil works was
initiated after enactment of Ley General del Equilibrio Ecologico y la
Proteccion del Ambiente but that have not received an environmental ranking
from SEDESOL.  No subprojects fall in this group.
                                                                  ANNEX 4
                                                              Page 1 of 1
                        Method of Economic Analysis
      The Guarantee Agreement (para. 3.06 (b)) specifies that all prices for
the ex-ante economic analysis are to be in world prices (i.e. import or
export parity prices, depending on whether Mexico is a net importer or
exporter of the commodity). It is understood that in some cases local market
equivalents may be used. The choice between world price equivalents and
local market prices will depend on the degree to which the product enters
international markets.
      A.               Output prices.  Import-parity prices are to be used
for grains (rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, barley, and all others that are
imported), oilseeds (soybean, safflower, sesame, and cottonseed) and milk
and dairy products. Export-parity prices are to be used for beef and live
animals, cotton, and fruits and vegetables. Local market prices can be used
for products that are largely non-traded, notably pastures.
      B.                Input prices.  Import-parity prices are to be used
for fertilizers. Official rates can be used for irrigation water. Other
Page  13
agricultural chemicals and largely non-traded inputs (e.g. fencing) can be

valued at their domestic market prices. Labor can be valued at market wages
prevailing in the project area. Land can be valued at rentals prevailing in
the project area.
      C.Transport and other intermediation costs.  The calculation of transport
and
other intermediation costs is to be made on the basis of relevant data to
be provided by ASERCA. Transport and other intermediation costs--capital,
handling, storage, insurance--are to be added to world prices up to the
project area for import-parity goods and subtracted from world prices
beginning at the project area up to the relevant world market for export-
parity goods.
      D.      Price and cost periods.  All prices and costs will be
specified in real terms in the period of analysis. Economic analysis will
typically be done for a period of 10 to 20 years, depending on the type of
investment. Price and cost periods will be taken as the annual average in
the year preceding the date of the feasibility study, or the average price
at harvest if the latter is more relevant (e.g. for some crops that have
sharply seasonal harvests and strong price fluctuations in consequence).
      E.              Exchange rates.  Exchange rates to convert world
prices into pesos are to be the average of market exchange rates for the
same period in which prices are calculated.
      F.    Producers' contributions.  Producers contributions in labor to
investments will be valued at prevailing local market wages for the type of
work contributed. The quantity of work contributed to each task will be
estimated on the basis of standard coefficients, as now applied by FIRCO.
Producers' contributions in materials will be valued at their actual
purchase cost.
