Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as

of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts

determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a

fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the

table in paragraph I of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original

Installment Share") and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining

Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal
Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the
Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the
Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating
to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

S. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the

Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
