to the monetarily quantifiable criteria specified in the 
bidding documents and a merit point system shall not be 
used. 

(4) Extension of bid validity shall be allowed once only for 
not more than thirty (30) days. No further extensions 
should be granted without the prior approval of the 
Bank.
(5) Contracts shall be awarded to qualified bidders having 
submitted the lowest evaluated substantially responsive
