Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan to an Approved

such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank 
under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
