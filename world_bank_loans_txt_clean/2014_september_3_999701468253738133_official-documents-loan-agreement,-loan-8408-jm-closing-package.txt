The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the

percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal

Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully

withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the

Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be

determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the

first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal
Payment Date.

Principal Payment Date Installment Share

On each February 15 and August 15

through February 15 , 2043 2.08%

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on

each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of

the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the

Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I
of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is

the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original

Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such

date.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the

principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as

withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which
invoices are issued on.or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the
provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for

each such amount.
