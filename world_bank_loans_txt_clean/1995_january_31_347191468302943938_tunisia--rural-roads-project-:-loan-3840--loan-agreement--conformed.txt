Description of the Project 

The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in 

improving the management of its roads sector, carrying out related 

suitable budgetary reforms, expanding the participation of the 

private sector in road maintenance, improving roads standards, 

reducing rural-urban migration and disparities between urban and

the enhanced delivery of social services. To these ends, the Project 

aims particularly at: (i) improving the maintenance of rural roads; 

(ii) decentralizing responsibilities for road management; (iii) 

establishing an appropriate link between budgets and road classi- 

fication and strengthening budgetary discipline, transparency and 

accountability; (iv) improving the efficiency of road maintenance 

works through an increased participation of the private sector; and 

(v) minimizing life-cycle costs of roads by optimizing the use of 

unpaved road techniques. 

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such 

modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon 

from time to time to achieve such objectives: 

Part A: Institutional Development 

Development and implementation of a program of institutional 

reforms designed to improve the management of the Borrower’s roads 

sector and its budgetary system, facilitate the participation and 

development of the private sector role in road maintenance works of 

the Borrower’s rural roads network and establish optimal road 

standards, consisting of: (i) the reclassification of the rural 

roads’ network; (ii) the establishment of an appropriate iink, 

respectively, between budgets, road standards and resources, and 

road ownership and classification categories; (iii) the identi- 

fication of the road maintenance works which can be carried out by 

the private sector more efficiently and at a lower cost; and (iv) 

the definition of optimal rural roads standards. 

Part B: Pilot Periodic Rehabilitation 

Carrying out, pursuant to Part A (iii) hereof, of a pilot 

program to periodically rehabilitate by contract, through the 

application of different types of road works consisting mainly of 

regravelling, about 300 kilometers of gravel roads located in ten 

(10) governorates. 

Part C: Rural Roads Upgrading 

Upgrading of about 715 kilometers of selected rural roads, 

including paving of selected portions, construction to minimal 

unpaved standards, and construction in anticipation of possible
