SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 

Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 

the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 

Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 

multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 

the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 

adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 

to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 

On each June 15 and December 15 

Beginning June 15, 2018 

 through June 15, 2038 

2.38% 

On December 15, 2038 2.42% 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 

Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 

as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 

determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 

fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 

table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 

Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 

Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 

date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 

referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 

applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 

amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 

outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 

with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 

on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-

paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 

such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 

Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 

Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 

the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 

to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 

the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 

relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 

Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 

Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
