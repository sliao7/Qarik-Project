SCHEDULE 1 

Project Description 

The objective of the Project is to identify social and/or fiscal attributes of physical 
persons and legal entities in Argentina, through a sustainable information exchange system aimed 
at improving the efficiency, effectiveness and impact of social services and fiscal programs at the 
federal, provincial and municipal levels. 

The Project constitutes the consolidation of the second part of the second phase, and the 
third phase, of the Program, and consists of the following parts: 
 
Part 1: Institutional and Legal Framework

(a) (i) Strengthening of SINTyS’ institutional framework, through, inter alia: (A) the 
definition of its organizational, operational, human resources and budgetary 
needs, and the design of the necessary legal norms to meet said needs; (B) the 
design and implementation of mechanisms that will permit SINTyS to coordinate 
initiatives with other Borrower agencies which have functions and 
responsibilities complementary to SINTyS, so as to clarify responsibilities, 
eliminate duplication, promote task-sharing, and achieve other positive synergies 
amongst the same; (C) the establishment of advisory bodies with a structure, 
functions and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank (which structure shall 
include representatives at the federal, provincial and/or municipal levels), and 
consultation mechanisms to support the dialogue and exchange of ideas among 
Participating Public Agencies in areas that are critical to SINTyS’ sustainability, 
such as data quality and exchange of information, technological framework, 
information security, priority plans, and monitoring and evaluation; (D) the 
design of institutional arrangements that will set forth the responsibilities and 
prerogatives of Participating Public Agencies as providers and/or users of 
social/fiscal information; (E) the design and implementation of monitoring and 
evaluation mechanisms and management tools to ensure the proper operation of 
SINTyS; (F) the design and implementation of alternative financial mechanisms 
(such as, for example, the design of cost-sharing and/or cost recovery 
mechanisms) to enable SINTyS to carry out its operations; and (G) the design of 
internal control mechanisms (including the hiring of specialists on internal 
auditing, acceptable to the Bank) to audit SINTyS’ operations; (ii) if requested by 
the Borrower, and as approved by the Bank, strengthening of the technical and 
institutional capacity of the Borrower’s national control entities to carry out non-
financial audits of SINTyS’ operations; and (iii) design of a framework to 
monitor and evaluate the activities associated with the exchange of social/fiscal 
information, and to measure the impact of the services resulting from said 
exchange of information.  

(b) Strengthening of SINTyS’ legal framework, through, inter alia: (i) the design of 

norms to supplement the current legislation which governs protection of personal 
information; (ii) the preparation of national legislation, which, once enacted, will 
oblige all Participating Public Agencies (at the federal level): (A) to exchange
social/fiscal information through SINTyS; (B) to provide SINTyS all relevant 
social/fiscal information; and (C) to prevent requesting social/fiscal information 
from citizens/legal entities if such information is already being collected and 
provided by the pertinent Participating Public Agency through SINTyS; (iii) the 
preparation of provincial legislation, which, once enacted, will oblige all 
Participating Public Agencies (at the provincial level): (A) to exchange 
social/fiscal information through SINTyS; (B) to provide SINTyS all relevant 
social/fiscal information; and (C) to prevent requesting social/fiscal information 
from citizens/legal entities if such information is already being collected and 
provided by the pertinent Participating Public Agency through SINTyS; and (iv) 
the preparation of supplementary legislation, which, once enacted, will 
strengthen the current national legal framework governing the use, dissemination 
and disclosure of information. 

(c) (i) Continuation of the establishment of SINTyS provincial field offices in all 

Participating Provinces for purposes of replicating the SINTyS’ social/fiscal 
information exchange model in said Participating Provinces (to adapt the same to 
the pertinent provincial needs), and the on-line interconnection of said model 
among the same, so as to facilitate the exchange of social/fiscal information 
among Participating Public Agencies; and (ii) expansion, on a pilot basis, of the 
SINTyS model mentioned in (i) herein in Participating Municipalities operating 
within the jurisdiction of any given Participating Province (in which a SINTyS 
provincial field office has been established, and said SINTyS model has been 
replicated to adapt the same to the pertinent provincial needs) so as to facilitate 
the exchange of social/fiscal information among Participating Public Agencies.     

Part 2: Information Management and Data Quality Framework

(a) Design of common data standards and formats to be adopted by Participating 
Public Agencies which exchange social/fiscal information through SINTyS.

and on the application of the corresponding compliance and enforcement of 
mechanisms.
(d) Digitalization of the information, and development of the pertinent data bases, in 
selected Participating Public Agencies responsible for generating key social and 
fiscal data, such as civil registries (Registros Civiles), registries of legal entities 
(Registros de Personas Jurídicas), registries of students (Legajos de Alumnos)
and real estate registries (Registros de la Propiedad).

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date Installment Share 
(Expressed as a Percentage) 

On each March 15 and September 15 
 Beginning September  15, 2013  
 through March 15, 2038 

2% 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date[, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
