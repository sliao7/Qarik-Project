as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 

amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 

a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 

in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment 

Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 

on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 

determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 

immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 

amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 

Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 

accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 

Rate. 

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 

Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
