5.4 percent; and (ii) an increase, in real terms, of the Induced Physical Capital Investment

budget decree for fiscal year 2010, and various tax and fiscal proposals.  Said economic program 
includes: 

(a) the creation of new taxes and modification of existing taxes (including an 
increase in tax rates); and 

(b) a temporary deficit and the use of non-recurrent revenues, including withdrawals

(c) amending fraction VI Bis of article 104 of the Securities Market Law requiring

about the issuer derivative positions and possible contingencies that said 
derivative positions imply for the relevant issuer’s financial situation.
5.  The Borrower has amended its Credit Institutions Law on May 6, 2009 in order to 
enhance the transparency and impact of the Borrower’s state-owned development financial 
institutions.  Among other provisions, said amendment establishes that:  

(a)  state-owned development financial institutions shall publish monitoring

6.  The Borrower has strengthened and enhanced its active labor market policies by: 

(a) improving the institutional set-up of the Borrower’s Temporary Employment 

Program (Programa de Empleo Temporal) by including the Borrower’s Sub-

Productividad Laboral) in the technical committee that coordinates said 
Temporary Employment Program, and  

(b) allowing said Temporary Employment Program to be implemented in urban areas 
in addition to rural areas. 

7.  The Borrower has issued the Decree Amending the Tariff for General Taxes on Imports 
and Exports Law in order to enhance trade, competitiveness and simplification of the Borrower’s 
external trade tariff structure, by reducing the most-favored-nation tariffs on manufacturing 
imports and increasing the number of duty-free tariff lines in a staged manner, over a five year 
period, starting January 1, 2009.
