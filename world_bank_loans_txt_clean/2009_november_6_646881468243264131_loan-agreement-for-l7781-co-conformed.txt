awarded on the basis of International Competitive Bidding procedures.

paragraph 3 of this section) 

(b) Shopping 

(c) Direct Contracting (with the Bank’s prior approval) 

(d) Community Participation (for Investment Subprojects as per procedures set forth in

3. Special Procedures for National Competitive Bidding 

(a) Before issuing any invitation to bid, the Borrower, through DAPR-ACCIÓN 
SOCIAL, shall prepare and furnish or cause to be prepared and furnished to the
Bank for approval, appropriate model bidding documents.  Once approved by the 
Bank, the Borrower, through DAPR-ACCIÓN SOCIAL, shall use, or cause to be 
used, said model bidding documents, as approved for bidding under the Project. 
Any change or departure from the model approved shall require Bank’s prior 
approval. 

(b) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or Colombians, will be 

treated equally and, particularly, no preference will be granted to any bidder or 
group of bidders for bid evaluation purposes.  Bidders shall be allowed to submit 
their bids by hand or through the post office or private mailing services.  There 
shall not be any requirement for any bidder to show evidence of the bidder's 
registration in any public registry, chamber of commerce or similar entity, 
whether in the Borrower’s territory or elsewhere, or to appoint a representative 
domiciled in the Borrower’s territory, unless and until such bidder is awarded the 
corresponding contract. 

(c) Bids shall be opened in a public meeting to which bidders and their 
representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and place for 
the opening meeting shall be set forth in the bidding documents. Bid opening 
shall coincide with, or take place promptly after, the final date and time of the 
period for bid submission stipulated in the bidding documents. 

(d)  Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to the 
responsive bidder who meets appropriate technical and financial standards of 
capability and whose bid has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid. 
Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the specifications, 
conditions and evaluation criteria stipulated in the bidding documents. If any 
factor additional to the amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid 
evaluation, such factor or factors and the quantified manner in which they will be 
applied for purposes of determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely 
stipulated in the bidding documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and 
comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor shall be the 
bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, including correction 
of arithmetic errors. 

(e) The provisions of paragraph 2.47 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, more 
specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the persons 
officially charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating the bids while 
they are performing their official duties, without the corresponding bidder's 
written authorization. Moreover, bidders shall not be required to provide such 
authorization as a condition to be entitled to bid. This confidentiality requirement 
shall apply until the award of contract is notified to the successful bidder.  
Thereafter, confidentiality of the bids shall be limited to those bid portions for 
which confidentiality has been specifically requested by the bidder in question.
C. Particular Methods of Procurement of Consultants’ Services

SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 
On each February 15 and August 15 

Beginning February 15, 2020 
 through and including August 15, 2024 

10% 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 

time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
