BPKP shall verify by February 28 that the Reference Unit Costs were 
provided in the subject Fiscal Year and represent a reasonable estimate

produced by Sub-projects undertaken by Selected Local Government 
by their Reference Unit Costs. 

BPKP shall verify a Sample of the Sub-projects in each Selected Local 
Government in accordance with the VO Terms of Reference to 
determine compliance with the Eligibility Criteria. Based on the

Selected Local Government for that Fiscal Year by 10%; and (B) for 

each Selected Local Government that has not utilized the Web-Based 
Reporting System for the reporting of DAK expenditures, BPKP shall 
multiply the Value of Qualifying Reimbursement for that Selected 
Local Government for that Fiscal Year by 7.5%; it being understood

LG Incentive and Reimbursement. Upon receipt by the Borrower of 
Reimbursement from the Bank in any Fiscal Year, MOF shall transfer 
to each Selected Local Government its respective LG Incentive and 
Reimbursement.

Year exceeded the amount eligible for rembursement by the Bank (the Value 
of Total Reimbursement) at the end of the Fiscal Year as set out in the 

Verification Report for that Fiscal Year, then the amount of the Advance 
Payment will be reduced in the subsequent Fiscal Year by the amount of 
overpayment in that Fiscal Year (Advance Payment minus Value of Total 
Reimbursement). The Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, reduce the 
amount of the Advance Payment, or decline to provide any Advance Payment, 
for any subsequent year of Project implementation in the event that this clause 
was invoked in any Fiscal Year.

as of such date in accordance with paragraph | of this Schedule.

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the 
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as

commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub- 
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate 
component of the Screen Rate. 

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 
provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such 
amount.
