Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures 
described in Part A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be 
granted a margin of preference in accordance with the provisions of 
the Guidelines, provided, however, that: 

l. All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall 
clearly indicate any preference which would be granted, the 
information required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such 
preference and the following methods and stages that will be 
followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
2. After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of 
the following two groups: 

(a) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if 
the bidder shall have established to the satisfaction of 
the Borrower and the Bank that such goods contain 
components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% 
of the value of the complete goods. 

(b) Group B: bids offering any other goods. 

3. In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, 
all evaluated bids in each group shall first be compared among 
themselves, without taking into account customs duties and other 
import taxes levied in connection with the importation, or the sales 

and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of 
the goods pursuant to the bids. Such lowest evaluated bids shall 
then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this 
comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected 
for the award. 

4. If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the 

lowest evaluated bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall 
be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group A after 
adding: 

(a) to the evaluated bid price of goods to be imported in 
each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the amount 

of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer 
would have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such 
group B bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods; and 

(b) to the evaluated bid price of goods supplied 
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the 
smaller of: (i) the amount of customs duties and other import taxes 

which would be levied on the goods offered in such group B if they 
originated from the same foreign country as the bid included in 
group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import 
taxes; or (ii) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. 

If, as a result of this comparison, the bid from group A is the 
lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the lowest 
evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, 
shall be selected for the award.
Part C: Other Procurement Procedures 

1. Goods and works, estimated to cost less than the equivalent of 
$250,000 and $4,000,000 per contract, respectively,up to an 

aggregate amount equivalent to $800,000 and $60,400,000, 

respectively, may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis 
of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in accordance with 
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. 

2. In the procurement of works in accordance with Part C.1l 
hereof, the Borrower shall use or cause to be used the standard 

bidding documents transmitted by the Borrower to the Bank through 
the letter dated April 8, 1994. 

Part Ds: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions 

l. Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final 
contracts: 

(a) With respect to each contract to be awarded pursuant to 

the provisions of Part A hereof and the first two contracts for 
goods and works to be awarded pursuant to the provisions of Part C 
hereof, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 
1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract 
are to be made out of the Special Account, such procedures shall be 
modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract 
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 
(d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first 
payment out of the Special Account in respect of such contract. 

(b) With respect to each contract not governed br the 

preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 
of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such 
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, said procedures 
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the 
contract together with the other information required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be 
furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement. 

(c) The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall 
not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals are to be 
made on the basis of statements of expenditure.

Schedule or the Guidelines, the following shall apply to the 
procurement of goods and/or works to be undertaken pursuant to Part 
C hereof:

evaluation to be based on price and, whenever appropriate, to 

also take into account factors similar to those referred to in

bid evaluation shall always be based on factors that can be 
quantified objectively, and the procedure for such 
quantification shall be disclosed in the invitation to bid. 

2. Whenever required by the Bank, the invitation to bid 
shall be advertised for at least three consecutive days in a 
newspaper of wide circulation in Brazil. 

3. The arrangements, under the invitation to bid, for a

of acceptance of bids, minimum and/or maximum amounts for the

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that

Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 

provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank

Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
