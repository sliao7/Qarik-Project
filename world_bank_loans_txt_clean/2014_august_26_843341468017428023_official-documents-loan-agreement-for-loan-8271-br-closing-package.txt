of this Schedule.

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which

invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any

withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion

Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for

each such amount.
