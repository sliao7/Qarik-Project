determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal
Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable
amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

accordance with paragraph I of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on each
Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by
the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share") and the
denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares for Principal
Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as
necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a
Currency Conversion applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following
the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any time the
Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after the
respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer
apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.
