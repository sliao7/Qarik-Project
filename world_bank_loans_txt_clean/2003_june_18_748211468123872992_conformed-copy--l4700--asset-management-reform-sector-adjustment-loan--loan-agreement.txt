the Bank shall establish.  The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later date.

percentage per annum. 

(iv) “LIBOR Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: (A) three 

fourth of one percent (3/4 of 1%); (B) minus (or plus) the

(c) The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate and LIBOR 

Total Spread for each Interest Period, promptly upon the determination thereof. 
 
(d) Whenever, in light of changes in market practice affecting the

determining the interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as provided in said 
Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest rates applicable to 
the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower of the new basis. The
