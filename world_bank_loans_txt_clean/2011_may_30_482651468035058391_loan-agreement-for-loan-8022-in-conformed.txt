(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) 

and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 

Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which 

invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 

provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any 

withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is 

repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 

Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 

exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one (1) Loan 

Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount 

denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization 

schedule for each such amount.
