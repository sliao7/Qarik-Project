procured under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures 
consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the 

"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines). 

(a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid 

referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, 
when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity 
period, the successful bidder's bid price will be increased for each 
week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to

the other to the local currency component of the bid price. Such an 
increase shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. 

(b) In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with 
this Part A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding 
documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the 
Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the 
Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been 
issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use bidding documents based 
on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the 
Bank. 

2. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods and works shall 
be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$3,000,000 or more. 

Part Bs: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers 

In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures 
described in Part A.l hereof, goods manufactured in Paraguay may be 
granted a margin of preference in accordance with, and subject to, 
the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines and 
paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto.
Part Cs: Other Procurement Procedures 

Goods or works estimated to cost the equivalent of less than

the case may be, eligible under the Guidelines, in accordance with 
procedures acceptable to the Bank; or (b) in the cases set forth in 
paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines, pursuant to direct contracting.

Section to be financed by each Financial Intermediary with the 
proceeds of its Intermediary Loan; and (iii) each contract procured 
pursuant to the provisions of Part C of this Section to be financed 
by each Financial Intermediary with the proceeds of its Intermediary 
Loan for goods and works estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$1,000,000 or more but less than the equivalent of $3,000,000, the 

procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the 
Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such contract are to be

of the Special Account in respect of such contract. 

(b) With respect to each contract not governed by the 
preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 
of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such 
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, said procedures 
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the 
contract together with the other information required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be 
furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.

Special Account 

1. For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) the term "eligible Category" means the Category set 
forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; 

(b) the term “eligible expenditures" means expenditures in 
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for 
Investment Projects and to be financed out of the proceeds of the 
Loan allocated from time to time to the eligible Category in 
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement, 
provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 
4 (b) of Section I of Schedule 7 to this Agreement, payments for 
expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of Free-limit 
Subloans may be made out of the Special Account before the Bank 
shall have authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account in respect 
thereof. Such expenditures, however, shall qualify as eligible 
expenditures only if the Bank shall subsequently authorize such 
withdrawals; and 

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount 

equivalent to $1,500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and 

deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this 
Schedule. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively 
for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this 
Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that 
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the 
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a 
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan 

Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested.
(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 
deposits into the Special Account at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, 

the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the 
documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment 
or payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 

withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into 
the Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested and as shall have been 

- shown by said documents and other evidence to 
have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures. 

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan 
Account under the respective eligible Category, and in the 
respective equivalent amount, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special 
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall 

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 
into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all 

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions cf Article V of the 
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement; or 

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated 

to the eligible Category, less the amount of any outstanding special 
commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the 
General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the 
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Category 
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such 
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date 
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 

expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure 
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A). 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 

outstanding amount. 

(e) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 

Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account 

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General 

Conditions.

case may be, with respect to such amount or portion of 
the Loan. Upon the giving of such notice, such amount or
