(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 

the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 

as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 

repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 

amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 

a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 

in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment
Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment 

Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable 

to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this 

Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 

Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 

payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 

second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable 

on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date 

following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 

at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 

or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 

no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 

Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 

on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 

determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 

immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 

amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 

Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 

accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 

Rate.  

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 

Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
