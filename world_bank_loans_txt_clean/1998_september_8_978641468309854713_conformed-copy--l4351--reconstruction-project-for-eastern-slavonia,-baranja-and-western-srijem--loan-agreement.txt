(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the

respective Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making 

payments for eligible expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of any

to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the respective 
Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal 
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. 
Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into any Special

expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.
