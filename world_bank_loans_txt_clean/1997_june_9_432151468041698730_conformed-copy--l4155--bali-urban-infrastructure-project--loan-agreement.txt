                    by a Participating Local Government in the Fiscal Year

                    both the Bank and the Participating Local Government
                    accept as reasonable and as to which the Bank has

                    since such notification which has, or may reasonably

                    the basis of the prevailing lawful rate of exchange at
                    which such other currency is, at the time of such

valuation, obtainable for the purposes of servicing
                    such debt, or, in the absence of such rate, on the
                    basis of a rate of exchange acceptable to the Bank.
