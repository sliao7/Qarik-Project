repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such

withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the

Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion

Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for

each such amount.
