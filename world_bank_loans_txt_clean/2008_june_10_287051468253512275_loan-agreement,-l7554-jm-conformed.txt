SCHEDULE 1 

Project Description 

The objectives of the Project are to: (a) improve the monitoring of children’s 
development, the screening of household-level risks affecting such development, and early 
intervention systems of the Borrower to promote such development; (b) enhance the quality of 
ECIs; and (c) strengthen early childhood organizations and institutions. 

The Project consists of the following parts: 
 
Part 1. Supporting the Implementation of the NSP in the Following Action Areas:

(a) Parenting Education and Support. This action area includes: (i) the 
strengthening of the ECC’s parenting sub-committee; (ii) the development and 
implementation of a national early childhood development parenting education 
and support sub-strategy; (iii) a public awareness campaign; (iv) the creation of 
an accreditation system for early childhood parenting education and support 
programs; and (v) a grant facility to support service providers in meeting 
accreditation standards. 

(b) Preventive Health Care for Children. This action area includes: (i) the 

reorganization of well-child clinics, including the mainstreaming of well-child 
services at the primary care level, the expansion of the staff, the introduction of 
an accreditation system for health centers offering well-child services, and the 
strengthening of the referral system; (ii) the transformation and scaling up of 
nutritional programs to sustain achievements in reducing under-nutrition and, at 
the same time, address the emerging epidemic of over-nutrition; and (iii) the 
introduction of a child health passport to be used in all health centers. 

(c) Screening, Diagnosis and Early Intervention. This action area includes: (i) the 

development of a national policy for screening, referral and early intervention; 
(ii) the development of a screening system for household-level risks and its 
application to all households enrolled in the Borrower’s income support program; 
and (iii) the strengthening of the early intervention system through a new cadre 
of health professionals, entitled child development therapists, who will address 
vision, hearing, speech impairments and behavioral development challenges. 

(d) Safe, Learner-Centered Early Childhood Facilities. This action area includes:  

(i) the strengthening of the inspectorate for the ECIs at the ECC (through the 
provision of Grants for the ECC); and (ii) the strengthening of the support system 
for ECIs, including:  (A) the recruitment of development officers to technically 
support ECIs (through the provision of Grants for the ECC); (B) the training of 
ECI caregivers in safety standards; and (C) the implementation of ECIs 
development plans to meet service standards (through the provision of Grants for 
Community Schools).
(e) Trained Early Childhood Practitioners. This action area includes the 
implementation of a comprehensive early childhood development human 
resource strategy which entails: (i) the reform of training curricula; (ii) the 
increase in the cadre of trained practitioners; (iii) the upgrading of skills of early 
childhood development practitioners; and (iv) the development of continuing 
education and licensing systems.  This will be supported through the provision of 
Grants for the ECC. 

(f) Early Childhood Development Sector Governance. This action area includes:  

(i) the reorganization of the ECC, including the expansion of its staff base; (ii) 
the development of a national early childhood development policy and local 
governance arrangements; (iii) the development of ECI management models; and 
(iv) the identification of specific budget lines of the Borrower’s national budget 
to allow for the comprehensive monitoring of early childhood development 
expenditures.  This will be supported through the provision of Grants for the 
ECC. 

(g) Evidence-Based Decision Making. This action area includes the strengthening 

of the national early childhood development management and information 
system and the national early childhood development statistics.  These systems 
will include the application of an internationally developed, locally adapted 
instrument to monitor the early child status and enable the ECC to report for the 
first time on the performance of the early childhood development system, 
including the human resources situation and the child development status at age 
four.  This will be supported through the provision of Grants to the ECC. 

Part 2. Technical Assistance

(a) Development and support of the implementation of a national policy on 
screening, referral and early intervention, including:  (i) the design of a screening 
system for risks affecting early childhood development at the household level; 
(ii) the development of a public education strategy about risks for children; (iii) 
the development of service delivery models for nutritional programs targeting 
different age groups; (iv) the development of a strategy for the reorganization and 
strengthening of well-child clinics; (v) the development of sub-strategies for 
early childhood parenting, including the mapping of existing parenting education 
and support programs of the Borrower, the development of an accreditation 
system for parenting programs, and the design of parenting public awareness 
campaigns. 

(b) Redesign of the Borrower’s grant facility supporting early childhood institutions, 

including the analysis of needs and gaps in service provision by ECIs. 

(c) Development of a comprehensive early childhood development human resource 
strategy, including the review of current compensation policies and the 
development of training modules for staff of ECIs. 

(d) Carrying out of studies to: (i) strengthen the legal framework governing early 

childhood development; (ii) develop a national early childhood development
policy; and (iii) elaborate proposals for local governance and ECI management 
models. 

(e) (i) Carrying out of the evaluation of the NSP at mid-term and towards the 

end of its implementation period; (ii) development of a national early childhood 
development monitoring and evaluation system; and (iii) development of an 
instrument for the measuring of the child development status at age 4. 

(f) Development of the Borrower’s Early Childhood Development National 

Strategic Plan for the period 2013-2017.
