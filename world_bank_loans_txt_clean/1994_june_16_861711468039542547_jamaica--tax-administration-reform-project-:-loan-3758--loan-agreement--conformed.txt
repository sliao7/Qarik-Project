SCHEDULE 4 

Procurement and Consultants’ Services 

Section I. Procurement of Goods 

Part A: International Competitive Bidding 

1. Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods shall be procured 
under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent 
with those set forth in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for 
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank 
in May 1992 (the Guidelines). 

(a) For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid 

referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, 
when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity 
period, the successful bidder’s bid price will be increased for each 
week of delay by two predisclosed correction factors acceptable to 
the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign currency components and 
the other to the local currency component of the bid price. Such an 
increase shall not be taken into account in bid evaluation. 

(b) In the procurement of goods in accordance with this Part 

A the Borrower shall use relevant standard bidding documents issued 
by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have 
agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Project. Where no 
relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, 
the Borrower shall use standard bidding documents based on other 
internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the Bank. 

2. To the extent practicable contracts for: 

(a) goods other than vehicles shall be grouped into bid 
packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more; and 

(b) vehicles shall be grouped into bid packages estimated to 
cost the equivalent of $250,000 or more.
Part B: Preference for Domestic Manufacturers and Regional 
Manufacturers | 

1. For the purposes of evaluation and comparison of bids for the 
supply of goods: (a) bidders shall be required to state in their bid 
the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the ex- 
factory price for domestically-manufactured goods; (b) customs 
duties and other import taxes on imported goods, and sales and 
similar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded; and 
(c) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight and other expendi- 

tures incidental to the delivery of goods to the place of their use 
or installation shall be included. 

2. For goods manufactured in Jamaica and in member countries of 
CARICOM, the Borrower may grant a margin of preference in accordance 
with, and subject to, the following provisions: 

(a) All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall 
clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the informa- 
tion required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such 
preference and the following methods and stages that will be 

followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids. 

(b) After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in 

one of the following groups: 

(i) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in 

Jamaica, if the bidder shall have established to 

the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank 
that the manufacturing cost of such goods 
includes a value added in Jamaica equal to at 
least 202 of the Ex-factory bid price of such 
goods. 

(ii) Group _B: all other bids offering goods from 

within Jamaica. 

(iii) Group _C: bids offering goods manufactured in a 

country, other than Jamaica, which is a party to 
CARICOM and entitled to preferential tariffs 
thereunder. 

(iv) Group D: bids offering any other goods.
(c) All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared 
among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import 
taxes on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes on 
goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest evaluated 
bid of each group. The lowest evaluated bid of each group shall then 
be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, 

a bid from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected 
for the award. 

(d) If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c) 
above, the lowest bid is a bid from group C or group D, all group C 
and group D bids shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated 
bid from group A or group B after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of 
the imported goods offered in each group C and group D bid, for the 
purposes of this further comparison only, an amount equal to the 
smaller of: (i) the amount of customs duties and other import taxes 

which a nonexempt importer would have to pay for the importation of 

the goods offered in such group C or group D bid; or (ii) 152 of the 
c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said customs duties and taxes 
exceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid or a group C bid is the 
lowest in such further comparison, it shall be selected for the 
award. 

(e) If, as a result of the further comparison under 

paragraph (d) above, a bid from group D is the lowest, all group D 
bids shall be finally compared with the lowest bid from group C,-as 
determined under paragraph (c) above, after adding to the c.i.f. bid 
price of goods to be imported offered in each group D bid, for the 
purposes of this final comparison only, an amount equal to the 

smaller of: (i) the difference between the amount of customs duties 

and other import taxes which would actually be payable for the 
importation of goods offered in such group D bid and for the 
importation of goods offered in the group C bid; or (ii) 152 of the 

c.i.f. bid price of goods to be imported offered in such group D 

bid. If the lowest bid in such comparison is the group C bid, it 
shall be selected for purposes of award; if not, the lowest bid from 
group D, as determined under paragraph (c) above, shall be selected 
for purposes of award. 

Part C: Other Procurement Procedures 

l. Goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $25,000 or less per 
contract, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to $120,000, may be 
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price
quotations obtained from at least three suppliers eligible under the 
Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. 

2. Database management computer software contracts for the TACS, 
up to an aggregate amount equivalent to $200,000, may be procured by 
direct contracting, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to 
the Bank. 

Part D: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions 

1. Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final 
contracts: 

(a) With respect to each contract for goods awarded under 
Part A hereof the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of 
Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such 
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, such procedures 
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the 
contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said 
paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making 

of the first payment out of the Special Account in respect of such 
contract. 

(b) With respect to each contract not governed by the 

preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 
of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments for such 
contract are to be made out of the Special Account, said procedures 
shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the 
contract together with the other information required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to ssid paragraph 3 shall be 
furnished to the Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement. 

2. The figure of 10% is hereby specified for purposes of 
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines. 

Section II. Employment of Consultants 

l. In order to assist the Borrower in the carrying out of the 
Project, the Borrower shall employ consultants whose qualifications, 
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be 
satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in 
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank 
on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World 
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published
by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines). For complex, 
time based-assignments, the Borrower shall employ such consultants 
under contracts using the standard form of contract for consultant’s 
services issued by the Bank, with such modifications as shall have 
been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract 
documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use other 
standard forms agreed with the Bank. 

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, 
the provisions of the Ccnsultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank 
review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, 
letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts 
shall not apply to contracts estimated to cost less than $50,000 
equivalent each. However, this exception to prior Bank review shall 
not apply to the terms of reference for such contracts nor to the 
first three contracts for consultants’ services to be financed with 
the proceeds of the Loan, to the employment of individuals, to 
single source selection of firms, to assignments of a critical 
nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank, and to amendments of 
contracts raising the contract value to $50,000 equivalent or above.
SCHEDULE 5 

Special Account 

l. For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) the term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1) and 

(2) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement ; 

(b) the term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in 
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for 
the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan 
allocated from time to time to the Eligible Categories in accordance 
with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 

(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount 
equivalent to $400,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and 
deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this 
Schedule. 

2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively 
for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this 
Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that 
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the 
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a 

deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the 
Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan 

Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts as 
the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 
deposits into the Special Account at such 
intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, 

the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment 
or payments in respect of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 

withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into 
the Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested and as shall have been 
shown by said documents and other evidence to 
have been paid out of the Special Account for 
Eligible Expenditures. 

All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan 
Account under the respective Eligible Categories, and in the 
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said 
documents and other evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special 
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall 

reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other 
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for Eligible 
Expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 
into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all 

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the 
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the 
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement; or 

(b) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated 

to the Eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding 
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal 
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories 
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and 
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such 
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date 

of such notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible 
Expenditures. 

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure 
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this 

Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 

deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 
cover further payments for Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 
outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the 

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special 
Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), 
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account 

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the .General 
Conditions.
