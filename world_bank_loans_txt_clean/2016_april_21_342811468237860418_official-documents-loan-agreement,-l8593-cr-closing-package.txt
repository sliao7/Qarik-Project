SCHEDULE1

Program Description

The objectives of the Program are to contribute to: (i) improving the timeliness and quality
of health services; and (ii) enhancing the institutional efficiency of the CCSS.

The Program consists of activities to be implemented by the Program Implementing Entity,
which approved a broad set of initiatives and actions to strengthen the health insurance - contained
in the 2015-2018 Strategic Plan and the Strategic Agenda for Strengthening Health Insurance - a
portion of which will be financially supported by the Loan and will allow for a gradual change in
the Program Implementing Entity in order to achieve sustainable results in the short, medium and
long term.

The Program focuses on three priority areas: (i) strengthening the health care model with
special emphasis on increasing the impact of Primary Health Care (PHC), integration of integrated
health care networks, and a more effective approach to prevention, early diagnosis, and control of
chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs); (ii) improving institutional management; and (iii)
optimizing financial management.

The Program consists of the following activities to be implemented by the Program
Implementing Entity:

Part I: Strengthening the Health Care Model

Boosting the scope and capacity of PHC facilities to prevent and control NCDs, and
integrating health services across different levels using international best practices, allowing for
comprehensive, timely treatment and ensuring continuity of care in the various levels of care of the
health insurance system, through the following activities:

(a) modernizing and strengthening the PHC network nationwide to improve the
quality of services, increase coverage of the population, and ensuring that the
network has greater capacity for prevention, early diagnosis, and control of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) and other conditions that are relevant to the local,
regional, and national epidemiological profile; and

(b) strengthening the integration of PHC services into the network of services at all
levels of care, including: (i) expanding infrastructure and equipment at the first and
second levels of care; (ii) improving human resources training to better attend to
the needs of patients; (iii) upgrading equipment; (iv) updating clinical guidelines
and pathways, with an emphasis on chronic conditions affecting a large part of the
population; and (v) implementing new mechanisms for integrating PHC with
second level services (hospitals) using international best practices.
Part H: Improving Institutional Management

Strengthening institutional capacity to better manage the Program Implementing Entityin general, and the health insurance in particular, including:

(a) aligning central level management to reduce the complexity of administrative
processes;

(b) reducing management in silos through linking health care decisions with their
impact on administrative and financial changes and nation-wide objectives; and

(c) increasing the use and impact of household data collected by the PHC teams by
digitalizing data and linking it to existing E-Health tools to generate big data pools
for directors and managers to enable them to better allocate resources and monitor
results.

Part III: Optimizing Financial Management

Improving the quality of financial data for the Program Implementing Entity's SeniorManagement and Board of Directors to enable them to closely monitor actuarial analysis andincome/expenditure trends, including:

(a) improving the institutional capacity in terms of financial and budgetary
management;

(b) adopting international best management practices to strengthen financial
management; and

(c) optimizing administrative, logistical and financial processes and procedures
supported by a comprehensive computerized system that allows for consolidated,
real-time financial information, including optimizing the units at the central level.
