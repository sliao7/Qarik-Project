respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for

for eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this 

Schedule. 

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that 

the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the 

Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 

Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a 

deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 

Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the 

Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan

the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the

or payments in respect of which replenishment is 

requested. On the basis of each such request,

withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into 

the Special Account such amount as the’ Borrower 

shall have requested and as shall have been 

shown by said documents and other evidence to 

have been paid out of the Special Account for 

eligible expenditures.

evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 

expenditures. 

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this 

Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits 

into the Special Account:

special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 

of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal 

the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 

provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) 

deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, 

refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or 

the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 

shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the 

Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such 

evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any 

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to 

cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower 

shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such 

outstanding amount.

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
