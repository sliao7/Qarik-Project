      NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                 Procurement

1.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost
the equivalent of three million Dollars ($3,000,000) or more
each shall be awarded through international competitive bidding
in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth
in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992
(the Guidelines), subject to the following modifications and
additions:

      (a)   Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the
following is substituted therefor:

            "2.8 Notification and Advertising

                   The international community should be notified
            in a timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This
            will be done by advertising invitations to apply for

inclusion in a bidder’s invitation list, to apply
            for prequalification, or to bid; such advertisements
            should be placed in at least one newspaper of
            general circulation in the Borrower’s country and,
            in addition, in at least one of the following forms:

           (i)     a notice in the United Nations publication,
                   Development Business; or

          (ii)     an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or
                   technical journal of wide international
                   circulation; or

         (iii)     a notice to local representatives of countries
                   and territories referred to in the Guidelines,
                   that are potential suppliers of the goods
                   required."

      (b)   The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21
of the Guidelines:

                   "As a further alternative, bidding documents
            may require the bidder to state the bid price in a
            single currency widely used in international trade
            and specified in the bidding documents."

      (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are
deleted.

      (d)   When contract award is delayed beyond the original
bid validity period, such period may be extended once, subject
to and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.59 of
the Guidelines, by the minimum amount of time required to
complete the evaluation, obtain necessary approvals and
clearances and award the contract. The bid validity period may
be extended a second time only if the bidding documents or the
request for extension shall provide for appropriate adjustment
of the bid price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for
the contract over the period of extension. Such an increase in
the bid price shall not be taken into account in the bid
evaluation.

      (e)   In the procurement of goods in accordance with this
paragraph 1, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard
bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications
thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the
purposes of the Loan. Where no relevant standard bidding
documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use
bidding documents based on other internationally recognized
standard forms agreed with the Bank.

2.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost
the equivalent of less than three million Dollars ($3,000,000)
shall be awarded:

      (a)   by purchasers required to follow the Borrower’s
public procurement procedures for the importation of goods, on
the basis of such procedures, provided that such procedures
shall have been found acceptable by the Bank; and

      (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with established
commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be
awarded on the basis of evaluation and comparison of quotations
obtained from suppliers from at least two countries, except
that direct contracting procedures acceptable to the Bank may
be used where considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the
Guidelines.

3.    Subject to the prior approval of the Bank, commonly traded
commodities may be procured through organized international
commodity markets or other channels of competitive procurement
acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with procedures

acceptable to the Bank.

4.    With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 1
of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior
to the submission to the Bank of the first application for
withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of such
contract, two conformed copies of such contract, together with
the analysis of the respective bids and recommendations for
award, a description of the advertising and tendering
procedures followed and such other information as the Bank
shall reasonably request.

5.    With respect to each contract referred to in paragraphs 2
and 3 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank,
prior to the submission to the Bank of the first application
for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect
thereof, such documentation and information as the Bank may
reasonably request to support withdrawal applications in
respect of such contract.

6.    The provisions of the preceding paragraph 5 of this
Schedule shall not apply to contracts on account of which
withdrawals from the Loan Account are to be made on the basis
of statements of expenditure.
