the following modifications and additions shall apply:

(1) Registration

(a) bidding shall not be restricted to pre-registered firms;

(b) where registration is required, bidders: (i) shall be allowed a reasonable
time to complete the registration process; and (ii) shall not be denied
registration for reasons unrelated to their capability and resources to
successfully perform the contract, which shall be verified through post-
qualification; and

(c) foreign bidders shall not be precluded from bidding. If a registration
process is required, a foreign bidder declared the lowest evaluated bidder
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to register.

submission of bids.

(3) Pre-qualification

When pre-qualification shall be required for large or complex works, invitations
to pre-qualify for bidding shall be advertised in at least one widely circulated
national daily newspaper a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the deadline for
the submission of pre-qualification applications. Minimum experience and
technical and financial requirements shall be explicitly stated in the pre-
qualification documents.

(4) Participation by Government-owned enterprises

Government-owned enterprises in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including those in the
Federation and RS, shall be eligible to participate in bidding only if they can
establish that they are legally and financially autonomous, operate under
commercial law and are not a dependent agency of the contracting authority.
Furthermore, they will be subject to the same bid and performance security
requirements as other bidders.
(5) Bidding Documents

Procuring entities shall use the appropriate standard bidding documents for the
procurement of goods, works or services, acceptable to the Bank.

(6) Bid Opening and Bid Evaluation

(a) bids shall be opened in public, immediately after the deadline for
submission of bids;

(b) evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the monetarily
quantifiable criteria declared in the bidding documents; and

Civil works contracts of long duration (more than 18 months) shall contain an
appropriate price adjustment clause.

(8) Rejection of Bids

All bids shall not be rejected and new bids solicited without the Bank's prior
concurrence.

(9) Securities

(a) bid security and performance security should follow the generally
accepted practice used in the local market;

(b) alternative methods such as bid securing declaration may be acceptable, in
which case the Borrower may require bidders to sign a declaration
accepting that if they withdraw or modify their bids during the period of
validity or they are awarded the contract and they fail to sign the contract
or to submit a performance security before the deadline defined in the
bidding documents, the bidder will be suspended for bidding in any
contract with the implementing unit; and

(c) no advance payment shall be made to contractors without a suitable
advance payment security. These securities shall be included in the
bidding documents in a text and format acceptable to the Bank.
(10) Right to inspect and audit

Each contract financed out of the proceeds of the Financing shall provide that the
suppliers, contractors and subcontractors shall permit the Bank, at its request, to
inspect their accounts and records relating to the procurement and performance of
the contract and to have said accounts and records audited by auditors appointed
by the Bank. The deliberate and material violation by the supplier, contractor or
subcontractor of such provision may amount to obstructive practice.

(11) Fraud and Corruption

The Bank shall declare a firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or for a
stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by the Bank, if it at any time
determines that the firm or individual has, directly or through an agent, engaged in
corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in competing for,
or in executing, a contract financed by the World Bank Group.

SCHEDULE 3

Amortization Schedule

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal
Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such
repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

(Expressed as a Percentage)

Beginning May 15, 2024 through 2%
November 15, 2048

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn
Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph I of this
Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph I of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal
Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each
such amount.
