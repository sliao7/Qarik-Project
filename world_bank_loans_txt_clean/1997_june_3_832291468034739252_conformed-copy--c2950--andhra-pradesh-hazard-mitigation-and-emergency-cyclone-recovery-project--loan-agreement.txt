between the Borrower and the International Development Association (the Association) 
of even date herewith (the Development Credit Agreement), has requested the Bank to 
assist in the financing of the Project;

General Conditions; Definitions

      Section 1.01. The “General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee 
Agreements for Single Currency Loans” of the Bank, dated May 30, 1995, with the 
modification of Section 6.03 set forth below (the General Conditions) constitute an 
integral part of this Agreement:

       (a) Section 6.03 is modified to read:

 “Section 6.03.  Cancellation by the Bank.  If (a) the right of the 
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account shall have been suspended with 
respect to any amount of the Loan for a continuous period of thirty days, or (b) at 
any time, the Bank determines, after consultation with the Borrower, that an amount 
of the Loan will not be required to finance the Project’s costs to be 
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, or (c) at any time, the Bank determines, 
with respect to any contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, that 
corrupt or fraudulent practices were engaged in by representatives of the 
Borrower or of a beneficiary of the Loan during the procurement or the execution of 
such contract, without the Borrower having taken timely and appropriate action 
satisfactory to the Bank to remedy the situation, and establishes the amount of 
expenditures in respect of such contract which would otherwise have been 
eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan, or (d) at any time, the Bank 
determines that the procurement of any contract to be financed out of the 
proceeds of the Loan is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to 
in the Loan Agreement and establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of such 
contract which would otherwise have been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of 

the Loan, or (e) after the Closing Date, an amount of the Loan shall remain 
unwithdrawn from the Loan Account, or (f) the Bank shall have received notice from 
the Guarantor pursuant to Section 6.07 with respect to an amount of the Loan, the Bank 
may, by notice to the Borrower and the Guarantor, terminate the right of the 
Borrower to make withdrawals with respect to such amount.  Upon the giving of such 
notice, such amount of the Loan shall be canceled.” 

      Section 1.02. Unless the context otherwise requires, the several terms defined 
in the General Conditions, the Preamble to this Agreement and in the Development 
Credit Agreement have the respective meanings therein set forth and the term 
“Development Credit Agreement” means the agreement of even date herewith between the 
Borrower and the Association for the Project, as such agreement may be amended from 
time to time, and such term includes the "General Conditions Applicable to Development 
Credit Agreements” of the Association, dated January 1, 1985, as applied to such 
agreement, and all schedules and agreements supplemental to the Development Credit 
Agreement.

      (c) The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate and LIBOR Total 
Spread for each Interest Period, promptly upon the determination thereof.
