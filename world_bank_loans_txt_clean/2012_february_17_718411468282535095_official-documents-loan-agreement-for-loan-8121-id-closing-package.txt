ANNEX 2 to SCHEDULE 2

National Competitive Bidding: Modifications to Procedures

The procedures applicable to the procurement of goods, works, and non-consulting
services under contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding shall be those of
the Pelelangan Umum (Public Tendering) and Pemilihan Langsung / Pelelangan
Sederhana (Simplified Tendering) methods as set forth in the Borrower's Presidential Regulation
No. 54/2010, with the modifications set out below in order to ensure economy, efficiency,
transparency, and broad consistency with the provisions of Section I of the Procurement
Guidelines, pursuant to paragraph 3.3 of said Guidelines. The Pemilihan Langsung / Pelelangan
Sederhana method shall apply to such procurement up to the financial thresholds specified in said
Regulation. In the event of a conflict between the Borrower's procedures and these
modifications, the latter shall govern.

1. Procuring entities shall use the appropriate standard bidding documents acceptable to the
Borrower and the Bank. The provisions of Section 1.14 (Fraud and Corruption) of the
Procurement Guidelines shall apply, and each bidding document and contract financed
out of the proceeds of the Loan shall include provisions on matters pertaining to fraud
and corruption as defined in paragraph 1.14(a) of said Guidelines and the contract
provisions set out in paragraph 1.14(e) of said Guidelines.

2. Foreign bidders shall not be precluded from bidding. If a registration process is required,
a foreign firm determined to be the lowest evaluated responsive bidder shall be given
reasonable time for registration. Foreign bidders shall not be required to form a joint
venture or sub-contract part of the supply of goods, non-consulting services, and works as
a condition for submitting bids or the award of the contract. Bidding documents shall be
made available, by mail or in person, to all international bidders who are willing to pay
the required fee.

3. No preference of any kind shall be given to any bidders.

4. Under the Pelelangan Umum method, bidders shall be allowed at least twenty-one (21)
days from the date of the invitation to bid or the date of availability of bidding
documents, whichever is later, to prepare and submit bids; this period shall be ten (10)
days under the Pemilihan Langsung / Pelelangan Sederhana method.

5. Bids invited under the Pelelangan Umum method shall be submitted in one (1) envelope
and evaluated using post-qualification.

6. No bidder shall be rejected merely on the basis of a comparison with the owner's
estimate and budget ceiling without the Bank's prior written concurrence.

7. Bid security, at the bidder's option, shall be in the form of a letter of credit or guarantee
from a reputable bank or other reputable financial institution and shall without exception
follow the form provided for this purpose in the bidding documents.

8. All bids shall not be rejected and new bids solicited without the Bank's prior written
concurrence.

9. Government-owned enterprises in Indonesia shall be eligible to participate in bidding

only if they can establish that they are legally and financially autonomous, operate under

Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by
multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b)
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule,
to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original
Installment Share") and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion
applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of
such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the
provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
