SCHEDULE 4

Special Accounts

1. For the purposes of this Schedule: 

(a) the term “eligible Categories” means  for the TEPGC Special Account, 
Categories (1) (a) and (2)(a), and  for the NCPGC Special Account Categories (1)(b) 
and (2)(b); 

(b) the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and consultants’ services required for Parts A and B of the 
Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time 
to the eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement; and 

(c) the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount equal to $15,000,000 in 
respect of the TEPGC Special Account and an amount equal to $8,000,000 in respect of 
the NCPGC Special Account, to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into 
the respective Special Accounts pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, 
provided, however, that unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Authorized 
Allocation shall be limited, with respect to the TEPGC Special Account, to an amount 
equal to $8,000,000 and, with respect to the NCPGC Special Account, to an amount equal 
to $ 6,000,000 until (i) in respect of the TEPGC Special Account and (ii) NCPGC 
Special Account, the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the 
total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant 
to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed  an amount equal 
to $150,000,000 .

2. Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the TEPGC Special 
Account or the NCPGC Special Account, as the case may be, has been duly opened, 
withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
said Special Account shall be made as follows: 

(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the said Special Account of an 
amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized 
Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the said Special Account 
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested. 

(b) (i) For replenishment of the said Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the said Special 
Account at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the 
basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the said Special 

Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested and as 
shall have been shown by said documents and other 
evidence to have been paid out of the said Special Account for 
eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be 
withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible 

Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said documents and other 
evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the said Special Account, the 
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank 
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into a Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 

accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; 

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the 
period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit 
reports required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of 
the audit of the records and accounts for the said Special Account; 

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals 
from the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General 
Conditions; or

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories for said Special Account, minus the total amount of all outstanding special 
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized 
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 
amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Category for said Special Account shall 
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such 
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall 
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the said Special 
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures.

6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of a 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished 
to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into said Special Account 
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank 
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into said Special Account shall 
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, 
as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in a Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in a Special Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
