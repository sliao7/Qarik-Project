GUATEMALA (“Borrower”) and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 

RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (“Bank”) for the purpose of providing 

financing in support of the Program (as defined in the Appendix to this Agreement).  The 

Bank has decided to provide this financing on the basis, inter alia, of: (a) the actions 

which the Borrower has already taken under the Program and which are described in 

Section I.A of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and (b) the Borrower’s maintenance of an 

appropriate macro-economic policy framework.  The Borrower and the Bank therefore 

hereby agree as follows:

Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this

the General Conditions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of the 

Withdrawn Loan Balance remains unpaid when due and such non-payment

Section II. Availability of Loan Proceeds 

A. General.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance

TOTAL AMOUNT  85,000,000 

C. Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds.   

1. No withdrawal shall be made of the Tranche unless the Bank is satisfied, based 

on evidence satisfactory to it, that a national and/or Regional state of emergency 

(estado de calamidad publica) exists in the Borrower’s territory as a result of a 

natural disaster which has been declared by a Borrower’s presidential decree and 

ratified by the Borrower’s Congress in accordance with the Borrower’s 

legislation. 

2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the receipt by the Bank of 

a request for withdrawal of an amount of the Loan, the Bank determines that a 

review of the Borrower’s progress in carrying out the Program is warranted, the 

Bank shall give notice to the Borrower to that effect.  Upon the giving of such
notice, no withdrawals shall be made of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance unless 

and until the Bank has notified the Borrower of its satisfaction, after an exchange 

of views as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of said Section 3.01, with the 

progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program. 

D. Deposits of Loan Amounts.  Except as the Bank may otherwise agree:   

1. all withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into an

management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. 

E. Excluded Expenditures.  The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the 

Loan shall not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines 

at any time that an amount of the Loan was used to make a payment for an

refund an amount equal to the amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts 

refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 

Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
