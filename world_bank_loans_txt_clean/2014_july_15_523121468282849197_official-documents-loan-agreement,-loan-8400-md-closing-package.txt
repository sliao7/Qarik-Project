procedure shall be subject to the following additional provisions:

Eligibility: Eligibility to participate in a procurement process and to be awarded a Bank-
financed contract shall be as defined under Section I of the Procurement Guidelines;
accordingly, no bidder or potential bidder shall be declared ineligible for contracts
financed by the Bank for reasons other than those provided in Section I of the
Procurement Guidelines.

Registration of Contractors and Suppliers: Registration shall not be used to assess
bidders' qualifications. A foreign bidder shall not be required to register as a condition
for submitting its bid, and a foreign bidder recommended for contract award shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to register, with the reasonable cooperation of the
Borrower, prior to contract signing.

Participation of Joint Ventures: Participation of Joint Ventures shall be allowed and all its
members shall be jointly and severally liable for the entire contract.

Bidding Documents: Bidding documents acceptable to the Bank shall be used, and shall
be prepared so as to ensure economy, efficiency, transparency, and broad consistency
with the provisions of Section I of the Procurement Guidelines.

Qualification: Qualification criteria shall be clearly specified in the bidding documents.
All criteria so specified, and only such specified criteria, shall be used to determine
whether a bidder is qualified. Qualification shall be assessed on a "pass or fail" basis,
and merit points shall not be used. Such assessment shall be based entirely upon the
bidder's or prospective bidder's capability and resources to effectively perform the
contract, taking into account objective and measurable factors, including: (i) relevant
general and specific experience, and satisfactory past performance and successful
completion of similar contracts over a given period; (ii) financial position; and where
relevant, (iii) capability of construction and/or manufacturing facilities. Prequalification
procedures and documents acceptable to the Bank shall be used for large, complex and/or
specialized works. The verification of the information upon which a bidder was
prequalified, including current commitments, shall be carried out at the time of contract
award, along with the bidder's capability with respect to personnel and equipment. In the
procurement of goods and works where pre-qualification is not used, the qualification of
the bidder who is recommended for award of contract shall be assessed by post-
qualification, applying the qualification criteria stated in the bidding documents.

Cost Estimate: The detailed cost estimates shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed
to prospective bidders. No bids shall be rejected on the basis of comparison with the cost
estimates without the Bank's prior written concurrence.

Bid Submission and Bid Opening: Prospective bidders shall be given at least thirty (30)
days from the date of publication of the invitation to bid or the date of availability of the
bidding documents, whichever is later, to prepare and submit bids. Bids shall be opened
in public, immediately after the deadline for submission of bids. Bids received after the
deadline for bid submission shall be rejected and returned to bidders unopened. A copy
of the bid opening minutes shall be promptly provided to all bidders who submitted bids,
and to the Bank with respect to contracts subject to the Bank's prior review.

Bid Evaluation: Evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the evaluation
criteria specified in the bidding documents. Evaluation criteria other than price shall be
quantified in monetary terms. Merit points shall not be used, and no minimum point or
percentage value shall be assigned to the significance of price, in bid evaluation.
Contracts shall be awarded to the qualified bidder whose bid has been determined: (i) to
be substantially responsive to the bidding documents; and (ii) to offer the lowest-
evaluated cost. No negotiations shall be permitted. A bidder shall not be required, as a
condition for award, to undertake obligations not specified in the bidding documents or
otherwise to modify the bid as originally submitted. A bidder shall not be eliminated
from detailed evaluation on the basis of minor, non-substantial deviations.

Reiection of All Bids and Re-bidding: All bids (or the sole bid if only one bid is received)
shall not be rejected, the procurement process shall not be cancelled, and new bids shall
not be solicited without the Bank's prior written concurrence.

Bid Validity: The bid validity period required by the bidding documents shall be
sufficient to account for any period that may be required for the approval and registration
of the contract as contemplated in the PPL. If justified by exceptional circumstances, an
extension of bid validity may be requested in writing from all bidders before the original
bid validity expiration date, provided that such extension shall cover only the minimum
period required to complete the evaluation, award a contract, and/or complete the
registration process, but not more than thirty (30) days; a corresponding extension of any
bid guarantee also shall be required in such cases. A Bidder may refuse the request for
extension of bid validity without forfeiting its bid guarantee. No further extensions shall be
requested without the prior written concurrence of the Bank.
Guarantees: Guarantees shall be in the format included in the bidding documents. The bid
guarantee shall be valid for twenty-eight days (28) beyond the original validity period of
the bid, or beyond any period of extension if requested. No advance payments shall be
made without a suitable advance payment guarantee. Performance security shall not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the contract amount.

Fraud and Corruption: The bidding documents and contract as deemed acceptable by the
Bank shall include provisions stating the Bank's policy to sanction firms or individuals,
found to have engaged in fraud and corruption as defined in the Procurement Guidelines.

Inspection and Audit Rights: Each bidding document and contract financed out the
proceeds of the Financing shall provide that bidders, suppliers and contractors, and their
subcontractors, agents, personnel, consultants, service providers, or suppliers, shall
permit the Bank to inspect all accounts, records, and other documents relating to the
submission of bids and contract performance, and to have them audited by auditors
appointed by the Bank. Acts intended to materially impede the exercise of the Bank's
inspection and audit rights provided for in the Procurement Guidelines constitute an
obstructive practice as defined in the Guidelines.

Contract Modifications: With respect to contracts subject to the Bank's prior review, the
Borrower shall obtain the Bank's no objection before agreeing to: (a) a material
extension of the stipulated time for performance of a contract; (b) any substantial
modification of the scope of services or other significant changes to the terms and
conditions of the contract; (c) any variation order or amendment (except in cases of
extreme urgency) which, singly or combined with all variation orders or amendments
previously issued, increases the original contract amount by more than fifteen percent
(15%); or (d) the proposed termination of the contract. A copy of all contract
amendments shall be provided to the Bank.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the
amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is

Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if

Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
