notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 6 (b) of the Annex
to Schedule 4 to this Agreement, payments for expenditures to
be financed out of the proceeds of free limit Sub-loans may be
made out of the Special Account before the Bank shall have
authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account in respect
thereof. Such expenditures, however, shall qualify as eligible
expenditures only if the Bank shall subsequently authorize such
withdrawals; and

     (c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
equivalent to $6,500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account
and deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3

Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish
the Special Account shall be made as follows:

     (a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of
the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.

     (b)     (i)     For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                     Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                     deposits into the Special Account at such
                     intervals as the Bank shall specify.

(ii)     Prior to or at the time of each such
                     request, the Borrower shall furnish to the
                     Bank the documents and other evidence
                     required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this
                     Schedule for the payment or payments in
                     respect of which replenishment is requested.
                     On the basis of each such request, the Bank
                     shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
                     from the Loan Account and deposit into the
                     Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                     shall have requested and as shall have been
                     shown by said documents and other evidence
                     to have been paid out of the Special Account
                     for eligible expenditures.

     All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in
the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified
by said documents and other evidence.

4.   For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.

5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:

     (a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement;

     (b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.02 (b)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;

     (c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or

     (d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories for Parts A and B of the Project,
less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General
Conditions with respect to Parts A and B of the Project, shall
equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation.

     Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories for Parts A and B of the Project shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after
and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that
all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as
of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments
for eligible expenditures.

6.   (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank

may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.

     (b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required
to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to
the Bank such outstanding amount.

     (c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.

     (d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.

     if such payment or import, to the knowledge of the Bank, is
     prohibited by a decision of the United Nations Security
     Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United

             of Article III, Section 3 of the Bank’s
             Articles of Agreement."
