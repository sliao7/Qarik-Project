such procedure shall be subject to the following additional provisions:

1. Eligibility: Eligibility to participate in a procurement process and to be awarded a
Bank-financed contract shall be as defined under Section I of the Procurement
Guidelines; accordingly, no bidder or potential bidder shall be declared ineligible
for contracts financed by the Bank for reasons other than those provided in Section
I of the Procurement Guidelines.

2. Registration of Contractors and Suppliers: Registration shall not be used to assess
bidders' qualifications. A foreign bidder shall not be required to register as a
condition for submitting its bid, and a foreign bidder recommended for contract
award shall be given a reasonable opportunity to register, with the reasonable
cooperation of the Borrower, prior to contract signing.

3. Participation of Joint Ventures: Participation of Joint Ventures shall be allowed
and all its members shall be jointly and severally liable for the entire contract.

4. Bidding Documents: Bidding documents acceptable to the Bank shall be used, and
shall be prepared so as to ensure economy, efficiency, transparency, and broad
consistency with the provisions of Section I of the Procurement Guidelines.

5. Qualification: Qualification criteria shall be clearly specified in the bidding
documents. All criteria so specified, and only such specified criteria, shall be used
to determine whether a bidder is qualified. Qualification shall be assessed on a
"pass or fail" basis, and merit points shall not be used. Such assessment shall be
based entirely upon the bidder's or prospective bidder's capability and resources
to effectively perform the contract, taking into account objective and measurable
factors, including: (i) relevant general and specific experience, and satisfactory
past performance and successful completion of similar contracts over a given
period; (ii) financial position; and where relevant; (iii) capability of construction
and/or manufacturing facilities. Prequalification procedures and documents
acceptable to the Bank shall be used for large, complex and/or specialized works.
The verification of the information upon which a bidder was prequalified,
including current commitments, shall be carried out at the time of contract award,
along with the bidder's capability with respect to personnel and equipment. In the
procurement of goods and works where pre-qualification is not used, the
qualification of the bidder who is recommended for award of contract shall be
assessed by post-qualification, applying the qualification criteria stated in the
bidding documents.

6. Cost Estimate: The detailed cost estimates shall be confidential and shall not be
disclosed to prospective bidders. The cost estimate will include all taxes including
Value Added Tax. No bids shall be rejected on the basis of comparison with the
cost estimates without the Bank's prior written concurrence.

7. Bid Submission and Bid Opening: Prospective bidders shall be given at least thirty
(30) days from the date of publication of the invitation to bid or the date of
availability of the bidding documents, whichever is later, to prepare and submit
bids. Bids shall be opened in public, immediately after the deadline for submission
of bids. Bids received after the deadline for bid submission shall be rejected and
returned to bidders unopened. A copy of the bid opening minutes shall be promptly
provided to all bidders who submitted bids, and to the Bank with respect to
contracts subject to the Bank's prior review.

8. Bid Evaluation: Evaluation of bids shall be made in strict adherence to the
evaluation criteria specified in the bidding documents. Evaluation criteria other
than price shall be quantified in monetary terms. Merit points shall not be used,
and no minimum point or percentage value shall be assigned to the significance of
price, in bid evaluation. Contracts shall be awarded to the qualified bidder whose
bid has been determined: (i) to be substantially responsive to the bidding
documents; and (ii) to offer the lowest-evaluated cost. No negotiations shall be
permitted. A bidder shall not be required, as a condition for award, to undertake
obligations not specified in the bidding documents or otherwise to modify the bid
as originally submitted. A bidder shall not be eliminated from detailed evaluation
on the basis of minor, non-substantial deviations.

9. Rejection of All Bids and Re-bidding: All bids (or the sole bid if only one bid is
received) shall not be rejected, the procurement process shall not be cancelled, and
new bids shall not be solicited without the Bank's prior written concurrence.

10. Bid Validity: The bid validity period required by the bidding documents shall be
sufficient to account for any period that may be required for the approval and
registration of the contract as contemplated in the PPL. If justified by exceptional
circumstances, an extension of bid validity may be requested in writing from all
bidders before the original bid validity expiration date, provided that such
extension shall cover only the minimum period required to complete the
evaluation, award a contract, and/or complete the registration process, but not more
than thirty (30) days; a corresponding extension of any bid guarantee also shall be
required in such cases. A Bidder may refuse the request for extension of bid
validity without forfeiting its bid guarantee. No further extensions shall be
requested without the prior written concurrence of the Bank.

11. Guarantees: Guarantees shall be in the format included in the bidding documents.
The bid guarantee shall be valid for twenty-eight days (28) beyond the original
validity period of the bid, or beyond any period of extension if requested. No
advance payments shall be made without a suitable advance payment guarantee.
Performance security shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the contract amount.

12. Fraud and Corruption: The bidding documents and contract as deemed acceptable
by the Bank shall include provisions stating the Bank's policy to sanction firms or
individuals, found to have engaged in fraud and corruption as defined in the
Procurement Guidelines.

13. Inspection and Audit Rights: Each bidding document and contract financed out the
proceeds of the Loan shall provide that bidders, suppliers and contractors, and their
subcontractors, agents, personnel, consultants, service providers, or suppliers, shall
permit the Bank to inspect all accounts, records, and other documents relating to
the submission of bids and contract performance, and to have them audited by
auditors appointed by the Bank. Acts intended to materially impede the exercise
of the Bank's inspection and audit rights provided for in the Procurement
Guidelines constitute an obstructive practice as defined in the Guidelines.

14. Contract Modifications: With respect to contracts subject to the Bank's prior
review, the Borrower shall obtain the Bank's no objection before agreeing to: (i)
a material extension of the stipulated time for performance of a contract; (ii) any
substantial modification of the scope of services or other significant changes to the
terms and conditions of the contract; (iii) any variation order or amendment (except
in cases of extreme urgency) which, singly or combined with all variation orders
or amendments previously issued, increases the original contract amount by more
than fifteen percent (15%); or (iv) the proposed termination of the contract. A
copy of all contract amendments shall be provided to the Bank.
SCHEDULE 3

Amortization Schedule

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan
repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal
Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such
repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

Principal Payment Date Installment Share
(Expressed as a Percentage)

On each June 15 and December 15
2%

Beginning June 15, 2021
through December 15, 2045

2. If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn
Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this
Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this
Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal
Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date
following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the adoption of such billing system.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate
that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the
Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if
the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the
exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5. If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each
such amount.
