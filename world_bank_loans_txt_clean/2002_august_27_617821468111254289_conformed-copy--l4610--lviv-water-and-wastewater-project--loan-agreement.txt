to the Bank  requests for deposits into the respective Special Account 
at such intervals as the Bank shall specify. 

(ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 

furnish to the Bank the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or 
payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the 
basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, 
withdraw from the Loan Account a deposit into the Special Account 
such amount as the Borrower shall have requested and as should
have been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been 
paid out of the Special Account for eligible expenditures. All such 
deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account 
under the eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent 
amounts, as should have been justified by said documents and other 
evidence. 

4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account, the 
Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank 
such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
eligible expenditures. 
 
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into the Special Account: 

(a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 

withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) 
of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; 

(b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period 
of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports 
required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the 
records and accounts for the Special Account; 

(c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention 
to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the 
Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 

(d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by 
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall equal the equivalent of 
twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan 
Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special 
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures. 
 
6. (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: 

(i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or 

(ii)  was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 

Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:
(A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; 
or 

(B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so 

request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or 
justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further 
deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made 
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be. 

(b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount 

outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 
the Bank such outstanding amount. 

(c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or 

any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account. 

(d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the 
General Conditions.
