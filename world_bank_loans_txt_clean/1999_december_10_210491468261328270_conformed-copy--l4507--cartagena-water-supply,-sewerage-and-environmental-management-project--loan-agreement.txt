deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the 
Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment.

SCHEDULE 2 

Description of the Project

The objectives of the Project are to: (a) improve the water and sewerage 
services in the territory of the Borrower and the sanitary conditions of the 

Borrower’s poorest population; (b) facilitate the environmental cleanup of water 
bodies surrounding the territory of the Borrower (Cartagena Bay, the Caribbean beaches 
and the Cienaga de la Virgen lake); and (c) improve the sustainability of water and 
sewerage services in the Borrower’s territory through a private sector participation 
model.

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 
thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives:

Part A: Water Supply System

Carrying out of the following activities for the expansion of the water supply 
system in the territory of the Borrower: (i) expansion and improvement of the water 
production system; (ii) expansion of the water service coverage; (iii) replacement of 
primary distribution mains; (iv) mitigation of adverse effects of water treatment 
sludge; (v) installation of remote control systems; and (vi) carrying out of a plan to 
reduce unaccounted water.

Part B: Sewerage System

Carrying out of the following activities for the expansion of the sewerage 
system in the Cienaga de la Virgen basin: (i) enhancement of the conveyance capacity 
of the existing sewage collectors in the southwest, southeast and central parts of the 
Borrower’s territory which currently drain into the Cienaga de la Virgen basin; (ii) 
expansion of the secondary sewerage network in those parts of the Borrower’s 
territory, and in the Boquilla area, which currently drain into such basin; (iii) 
construction of new pressure lines and pumping stations; and (iv) construction of new 
gravity collectors in residential areas.

Part C: Wastewater Conveyance System

Construction of the main wastewater conveyance system consisting of a 72" 
reinforced concrete cylindrical pressure pipe with a total length of about 23.85 
kilometers, including upgrading of the Paraíso pumping station, construction of the 
pipeline from such station to the treatment plant site, and construction of the 
effluent pipeline from the treatment plant to the submarine outfall under Part E of 
the Project.

Part D: Wastewater Treatment

Construction of wastewater treatment facilities to remove floatable materials, 
grease, oil, sand and grit.  The facilities will include the following or equivalent 
installations: (i) six rotary screens which will remove rags, floatable materials and 
large solids, with an expected volume of screenings of about 8.5 cubic meters per day; 
and (ii) two vortex-type grit chambers which will remove about 5.1 cubic meter per day 
of sand and grit.

Part E: Submarine Outfall

Construction of a submarine outfall for the safe discharge of pre-treated 
effluents into the Caribbean sea near Punta Canoa.  The outfall will be constructed 
using a 72" reinforced concrete pipe, will have a length of about 2,850 meters and its 
discharge point will be submerged at a depth of 20 meters.

Part F: Industrial Wastewater Discharge Control

Provision of technical assistance for: (i) the carrying out of a survey to 
identify key sources of industrial pollution in the territory of the Borrower; (ii) 
the establishment of a system to regulate discharge of industrial wastes, either to 
the sewerage system or to receiving bodies; (iii) the establishment of a system to 
audit the status of industrial wastes discharge; (iv) the development of strategies 
for control of small and dispersed sources of industrial pollution discharging to the 
sewerage networks; and (v) selection and design of industrial waste pre-treatment 
processes.

Part G: Environmental and Social Component

Carrying out of: (a) the environmental management program, described in Chapter 
V of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report prepared by ACUACAR in March 1999, for 
the activities under Parts B through F of the Project, consisting, inter alia, of: (i) 
environmental supervision during construction works under such Parts of the Project; 

(ii) restoration and conservation of the Cienaga de la Virgen nature reserve, 
including an environmental education program in communities living in such area; (iii) 
a monitoring program before and after construction of the submarine outfall under Part 
E of the Project to study the fate of pathogenic coliforms and other contaminants 
discharged through such outfall; and (iv) an environmental institutional strengthening 
program; and (b) the social management program, described in the Project Social 
Assessment Report dated October 1998, consisting, inter alia, of: (i) a social 
consultation and communication program; (ii) organization and strengthening of the 
communities of La Boquilla, Punta Canoa, Las Palmeras, El Pozon, and Manzanillo del 
Mar; (iii) construction, rehabilitation and equipping of community centers in La 
Boquilla, Punta Canoa, and Las Palmeras; (iv) support of in-house basic sanitation in 
La Boquilla and other poor neighborhoods in the Borrower’s territory; and (v) 
strengthening of the community relations unit of ACUACAR.

Part H: Project Management

Provision of technical assistance in the design and supervision of the 
activities under Parts A, B, C, D and E of the Project, the auditing of procurement 
procedures, and the overall management of the Project.
