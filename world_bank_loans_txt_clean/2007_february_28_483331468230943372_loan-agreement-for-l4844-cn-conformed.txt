SCHEDULE 1 

Project Description 

The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to improve the effectiveness 
of forest management and institutional arrangements in timber production, watershed 
protection and natural reserves management in selected areas of the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region. 

The Project consists of the following parts: 

Part A: Expanding Timber Plantations

1. Establishing in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way of 
about 200,000 hectares of timber plantations with high quality planting materials of about 
eleven selected species (Part 1 Selected Species) in selected Project sites in about 37 
Participating Counties by Participating Forest Farms and Participating Sub-borrowers. 
 
2. Provisions of technical support for afforestation through:  

(a) planting stock development comprising the introduction of improved 
genetic materials, the production of approximately 424 million seedlings 
required for the Project and nursery management at about 33 permanent 
central nurseries (Participating Nurseries) including expansion of four 
forest farm nurseries (Participating Forest Farm Nurseries); and  

(b) construction of small guard and storage sheds by Participating Forest 

Farms and Participating Sub-borrowers. 

Part B: Increasing of Ecological Forest Cover

1. Establishing approximately 18,000 hectares of multiple-use protection forests 
(Protection Forests) through planting of sixteen selected species (Part 2 Selected 
Species). 
 
2. Promoting forest regeneration and vegetation rehabilitation in approximately 
100,000 hectares in about 25 Participating Counties through hill closure restricting 
consumptive use of forest resources in watershed and karst areas. 
 
3. Establishing a Bio-carbon pilot of approximately 4,000 hectares of multiple use 
protection forests for carbon sequestration and test carbon trade processes.

Nature Reserves. 
 
2. Development and implementation of management plans for the Participating 
Nature Reserves (Nature Reserve Management Plans), including construction of small-
scale facilities; training of Participating Nature Reserve; training of key stakeholders
