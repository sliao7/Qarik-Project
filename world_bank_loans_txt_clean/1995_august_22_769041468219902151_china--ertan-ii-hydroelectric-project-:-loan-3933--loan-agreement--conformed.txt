(a) For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the

such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,

such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b) (i) For replenishment of the Special Account, the 

Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for 

deposits into the Special Account at such 

intervals as the Bank shall specify.

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) 

provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)

refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
