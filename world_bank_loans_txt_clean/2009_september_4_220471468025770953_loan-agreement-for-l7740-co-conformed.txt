SCHEDULE 1 

Program Actions; Availability of Loan Proceeds 
 
Section I. Actions under the Program

The actions taken by the Borrower under the Program include the following: 
 
A. Strengthening of Prudential Regulation and Supervision

1. The Borrower has initiated a program of administrative, technical and legal actions aimed 
at strengthening its financial system in order to be better prepared to manage the impacts 
of an economic downturn, through the adoption of a series of precautionary measures, 
including, inter alia: 

(a) the resiliency of the credit institutions has been strengthened in order to manage 
eventual credit losses, through the implementation of a countercyclical policy, 
issued by the Financial Superintendency, instructing said institutions to retain a 
portion of their profits earned during the period June-December, 2008 (in a 
capital reserve), as evidenced by the Letter Nº 2009037259
000 issued by 
the Financial Superintendency on May 8, 2009; and 

(b) the financial sector institutions regulated by the Financial Superintendency –

except for insurance companies – are better prepared to manage liquidity risks 
through the implementation of internal systems (comprising, inter alia, policies 
and procedures to deal with liquidity risk; a framework to measure such risk and 
a standardized framework to compute the liquidity gap) to measure and 
administer such risks as required by the issuance of Circular Nº 16.   

B. Strengthening of the Framework for the Intervention and Resolution of Unauthorized 

Financial Intermediation Activities

1. The Borrower has strengthened its ability to conduct the administrative intervention of 
the entities that carry out unauthorized financial intermediation activities, by collecting 
resources or cash from the public without proper authorization or regulation by the 
Financial Superintendency, through a series of actions aimed at: 

(a)  providing the Superintendency of Companies with the legal mandate to take 
strategic and precautionary measures, including inter alia: taking control of said 
entities, taking possession and/or ordering the freezing of their assets, and 
returning resources or funds to the affected persons, as evidenced by the 
enactment of Decree Nº 4334; and 

(b)  providing the heads of local governments (Mayors and Governors) with the legal 
mandate to take precautionary measures, including those necessary to close the 
premises of said entities located in their respective jurisdictions, as evidenced by 
the enactment of Decree Nº 4335.
C. Securities Market Reform

1. The Borrower has initiated a program of legal, administrative and technical actions aimed 
at upgrading the securities market by reducing transaction costs and systemic risks, 
including, inter alia:

(a) the strengthening of securities clearing and settlement systems by: (i) providing 
legal certainty to market participants undertaking securities transactions; and (ii) 
establishing criteria to determine the finality of said transactions, as evidenced by 
the enactment of Decree Nº 1456;

(b) the regulation of automatic trading and registration systems to establish 
information technology requirements that would provide security and 
transparency and reduce operational risks, as evidenced by the enactment of 
Decree Nº 1120; and 

(c)  the regulation of the operations of a central counterparty clearing house 

responsible for the provision of clearing and settlement services for exchange 
traded derivatives, as evidenced by the enactment of Decree Nº 2893.  

2. The Borrower has initiated a program of legal, administrative and technical actions 

aimed at enhancing the transparency of market architecture and operations, by carrying 
out a series of strategic actions, including, inter alia:

(a) the establishment of a series of principles, policies and procedures with a view to 
regulate the securities intermediation and operations activities, by imposing 
stricter requirements aimed at: (i) improving the professionalism of the 
intermediaries; (ii) protecting investor rights; and (iii) increasing the transparency 
of the market by requiring mandatory reporting of all over-the-counter 
transactions to a securities trading registry regulated by the Financial 
Superintendency, as evidenced by the enactment of Decree Nº 1121; and 

(b) the regulation of the trading of derivatives products, including through the 

issuance of accountancy criteria, as well, as the treatment of exposures for the 
purpose of computing counterparty credit risks in line with international 
standards, as evidenced by the enactment of Decree Nº 1796. 

Section II. Availability of Loan Proceeds

A. General.  The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in accordance with the

not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines at any time that an

SCHEDULE 2 

Amortization Schedule 
 
1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 

percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Principal Payment Date Installment Share 

(Expressed as a Percentage) 
On each August 1 and February 1 
 Beginning August 1, 2017  
 through February 1, 2035 

2.7% 
On August 1, 2035  2.8% 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 

Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 

each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 

3. (a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 

time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system.  

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
