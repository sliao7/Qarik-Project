respect of any portion of the Loan: (i) have received no 
applications or requests permitted under subparagraphs (a) or 
(b) of said paragraph; or (ii) have denied any such 
applications or requests, the Bank may, by notice to the 
Borrower, terminate the right to submit such applications or 
approvals or to make withdrawals from the Loan Account, as the

SCHEDULE 9 

Single Currency LIBOR Determination 

l. Single Currency LIBOR for any Single Currency for any Interest 
Period shall be the offered rate for deposits in the Single Currency 
for a period of six months which appears on the display designated 
as page "3750" on the Telerate monitor (or such other page or 
service as may replace it for the purpose of displaying London 
interbank offered rates of major banks for Single Currency 
deposits), as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second day on which 

banks and foreign exchange markets are open for business in London 
prior to the relevant January 15 or July 15 (the Interest 
Determination Date). 

2. If such rate does not appear on the Telerate monitor or on 
such service as may replace it, the Bank shall request the London 
offices of four major banks to provide the Bank with the rate at 
which deposits in the Single Currency are offered by such banks on 
the Interest Determination Date to leading banks in the London 
interbank market for a period of six months ending on the last day 
of such Interest Period. Single Currency LIBOR for such Interest 
Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to 
the fifth decimal place) of such offered quotations as determined by 
the Bank. 

3. If not more than one major bank provides the Bank with such 
quotations under paragraph 2 above, Single Currency LIBOR shall be 
the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the fifth 
decimal place) determined by the Bank of the rates quoted by at 

least two major banks in New York City for U.S. Dollars and 
Frankfurt for Deutsche Marks, as the case may be selected by the 
Bank on the Interest Determination Date for loans in the Single 
Currency to leading European banks for a period of six months ending 
on the last day of such Interest Period. If fewer than two of the 
banks so selected are quoting such rates, Single Currency LIBOR 
shall be the Single Currency LIBOR in effect for the last preceding 
Interest Period.
