SCHEDULE 3 

Amortization Schedule 

1. The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (Installment Share).  If the proceeds of the Loan shall have been fully withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) the total principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding as of 
the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment 
Date, such repayment amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 

Installment Share 
Payment Date (Expressed as a %)

On each February 15 and August 15 
Beginning on August 15, 2008 through 
February 15, 2009     5% 

On August 15, 2009 through February 15, 2012  4.75% 

On August 15, 2012 through February 15, 2015  4% 

On August 15, 2015 through February 15, 2020  3.75% 

2.  If the proceeds of the Loan shall not have been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on 
each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan shall have been withdrawn as 
of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the amount withdrawn and 
outstanding as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

(b) Any withdrawal made after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (the Original 
Installment Share) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, 
such repayment amounts to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to 
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.
3. (a) Withdrawals made within two calendar months prior to any Principal 
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts payable 
on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the second 
Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of  withdrawal. 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph 3, 

if at any time the Bank shall adopt a due date billing system under which invoices are 
issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system. 
 
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the withdrawn principal amount of the Loan 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in said Approved Currency that shall 
be repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, 
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of 
denomination immediately prior to said Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that 
reflects the amounts of principal in said Approved Currency payable by the Bank under 
the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to said Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so 
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component 
of the Screen Rate. 
 
5. If the principal amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time 
shall be denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the provisions of this Schedule 
shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to 
produce a separate amortization schedule for each amount.
SCHEDULE 4

Section I. Procurement of Goods and Works

Part A: General

Goods and works shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of Section 
I of the “Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” published by 
the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and 
January 1999 (the Guidelines) and the following provisions of this Section. 

Part B: International Competitive Bidding

1. Except as otherwise provided in Part C of this Section, goods and works shall be 
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the provisions of Section II of the 
Guidelines and paragraph 5 of Appendix 1 thereto. 
 
2. The following provisions shall apply to goods to be procured under contracts 
awarded in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Part B: 

(a)  Grouping of Contracts

To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped in bid packages 
estimated to cost $ 250,000 equivalent or more each. 

(b) Preference for Domestically Manufactured Goods

The provisions of paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 of the Guidelines and Appendix 2 
thereto shall apply to goods manufactured in the territory of the Borrower. 
 
Part C: Other Procurement Procedures

1. National Competitive Bidding

(a) Goods estimated to cost less than $ 250,000 equivalent per contract may 
be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.3 
and 3.4 of the Guidelines. 

(b) Works estimated to cost less than $5,000,000 equivalent per contract 
may be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the Guidelines.
(c) Before issuing  any invitation to bid, the Borrower shall prepare and 
furnish or cause to be prepared and furnished to the Bank for approval, appropriate model 
bidding documents. Once approved by the Bank, the Borrower shall use, or cause to be 
used, said model bidding documents, as approved for bidding under the Project. Any 
change or departure from the model approved shall require Bank’s prior approval. 

(d) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or Colombians, 

will be treated equally and, particularly, no preference will be granted to any bidder or 
group of bidders for bid evaluation purposes. Bidders shall be allowed to submit their 
bids by hand or through the post office or private mailing services. There shall not be any 
requirement for any bidder to show evidence of the bidder's registration in any public 
registry, chamber of commerce or similar entity, whether in Colombia or elsewhere, or to 
appoint a representative domiciled in Colombia, unless and until such bidder is awarded 
the corresponding contract. 

(e) Bids shall be opened in a public meeting to which bidders and their 
representatives shall be allowed to attend if they so wish. Date, time and place for the 
opening meeting shall be set forth in the bidding documents. Bid opening shall coincide 
with, or take place promptly after, the final date and time of the period for bid submission 
stipulated in the bidding documents. 

(f) Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to 
the responsive bidder who meets appropriate technical and financial standards of 
capability and whose bid has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid. Such 
determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the specifications, conditions and 
evaluation criteria stipulated in the bidding documents. If any factor additional to the 
amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid evaluation, such factor or 
factors and the quantified manner on which they will be applied for purposes of 
determining the lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely stipulated in the bidding 
documents. For purposes of bid evaluation and comparison, the only bid amount or 
amounts to be used as a factor shall be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in the 
corresponding bid, including correction of arithmetic errors. 

(g) The provisions of paragraph 2.46 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, 
more specifically, bids shall not be disclosed to persons other than the persons officially 
charged with the task of comparing and/or evaluating the bids while they are performing 
their official duties, without the corresponding bidder's written authorization. Moreover, 
bidders shall not be required to provide such authorization as a condition to be entitled to 
bid. This confidentiality requirement shall apply until the award of contract is notified to 
the successful bidder. Thereafter, confidentiality of the bids shall be limited to those bid 
portions for which confidentiality has been specifically requested by the bidder in 
question.
2. Shopping

(a) Goods estimated to cost less than $ 50,000 equivalent per contract, up to an 
aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000, may be procured under contracts awarded on 
the basis of international or national shopping procedures, at the Borrower’s option, in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines. 

(b) The Borrower shall obtain and compare at least three quotations to establish 
reasonableness of price.  Comparison of two quotations is justified only when there is 
evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, that there are only two reliable sources of supply 
(national or foreign as the case may be). For international shopping, the Borrower shall 
request quotations of suppliers from at least two different countries, including the country 
of the Guarantor. Quotation for foreign goods located in the Guarantor’s country and 
offered by a firm located in the Guarantor’s country, are considered as quoted from 
abroad for purposes of satisfying the “two different countries” rule. 

(c) The Borrower shall verify that the firms invited to quote are reputable, well 
established, and are suppliers of the goods or services being purchased as part of their 
normal business. 

(d) The Borrower shall request quotations by letter, fax, telex, electronic 
messaging, etc., (with proof of receipt and record keeping). Since quotation requests must 
be sent to reputable and well-established suppliers only, the requests should not be open 
to any other supplier and should not be made public. Suppliers shall submit their 
quotations in writing, (i.e., by fax, telex, letter, or electronic messaging with copies to be 
kept for the records).  No bid security is required.  There is no requirement for strict time 
and date for submission of quotations and for public opening, but normally requests for 
quotes indicate the expected date of submission of quotes, within one or two weeks of the 
initial request. 
 
3. Procurement of Small Works

(a) Works estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent per contract, may be 
procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations 
obtained from three (3) qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. 

(b) Before issuing any invitation to bid, the Borrower shall prepare or cause to be 
prepared and furnish to the Bank for approval, appropriate model invitation documents. 
Once approved by the Bank, the Borrower shall use, or cause to be used said model 
invitation documents, for bidding under the Project. Any change or departure from the 
model so approved, shall require Bank’s prior approval. 

(c) The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including 
basic specifications, the required completion date, the basic form of agreement acceptable 
to the Bank and relevant drawings, where applicable.
(d) The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price 

quotation for the required work and who has the experience and resources to complete the 
contract successfully. 
 
Part D: Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions

1. Procurement Planning

Prior to the issuance of any invitations to bid for contracts, the proposed 
procurement plan for the Project shall be furnished to the Bank for its review and 
approval, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Appendix 1 to the 
Guidelines. Procurement of all goods and works shall be undertaken in accordance with 
such procurement plan as shall have been approved by the Bank and with the provisions 
of said paragraph 1.
