## Background
Large swaths of the world's information are hidden away in unstructured and poorly-accessible formats. For instance, it is estimated that trillions of PDF files are in existence[^1], with tens of millions more posted to the internet each day. These formats pose a challenge for data extraction and analysis. PDFs are a double challenge: much of the information they contain is encoded in natural language, and further, many such files are generated by scanning paper documents, leaving them without computer-readable text. Reliably obtaining machine-usable information from PDF files is therefore a valuable capability.

The [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) is an international development organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. that provides loans and aid for projects in developing countries. The Bank has existed for decades, and while a large amount of its data is readily available via a standardized API[^2], much of it is still buried in PDF files. For example, the Bank's loan agreements are only available as unstructured PDF files.

## Objective
Our goal is to demonstrate the ability to extract useful information and insights from unstructured PDF files. We do this by analyzing a collection of World Bank loan agreements. These are formulaic but inconsistently structured.


## Approach
We received a collection of 3,205 PDF files scraped from the World Bank's database of loan agreements. Some of these PDFs contained machine-readable text, while others were simple scans. We first built a pipeline to extract and clean the text from these files. We used the open-source package [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF) to perform OCR on the scanned files, and [Tika](https://tika.apache.org) to programmatically extract the text from the files. We then discarded extremely short files and files with a high proportion of symbols likely to be OCR artifacts.

With cleaned full-text extracted, we set about finding features that could be consistently extracted from the agreements. These included:

- Segmentation into sections
- Date of the agreement
- Name of country making the agreement
- Name of the project
- Amount of the loan
- Ending date of the loan agreement

The World Bank has a [database of information about projects](http://search.worldbank.org/api/v2/projects) which is accessible via an API. However, the loan agreements are not linked to the entries in this database. We were able to match many of the agreements to projects with high confidence by using fuzzy string matching on the project names, and from the project database find the economic sector corresponding to these agreements. However, many more documents remained unmatched. This provided an opportunity to build a model that uses information from the agreements themselves to predict the project sector.
